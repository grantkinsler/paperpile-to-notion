  abstract  = "Evolution of large asexual cell populations underlies ∼30\% of
               deaths worldwide, including those caused by bacteria, fungi,
               parasites, and cancer. However, the dynamics underlying these
               evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because they
               involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never
               rise above extremely low frequencies in the population. To
               observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we
               constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage
               tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to
               monitor the relative frequencies of ∼500,000 lineages
               simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that
               the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is
               neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a
               predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly
               reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon
               outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in
               variability between replicates. These results suggest that early
               evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time
               before stochastic effects become important. Random DNA barcodes
               were used to simultaneously track hundreds of thousands of
               lineages in large cell populations, revealing deterministic
               dynamics early in their evolution. The dynamics underlying the
               evolution of large asexual cell populations such as bacteria,
               fungi, parasites and cancers remain poorly understood because
               they involve many competing lineages. To study these dynamics,
               Sasha Levy et al. have constructed a sequencing-based ultra
               high-resolution lineage tracking system in the yeast
               Saccharomyces cerevisiae and use it to monitor the relative
               frequencies of approximately 500,000 lineages simultaneously.
               They find that although individual mutations occur at random, the
               early dynamics of the population as a whole is a predictable
               outcome of the population size and the distribution of mutation
               rates to each fitness effect, and is strikingly reproducible.",

              and the changing influence of mutational processes3. Here, by

              evolution of mutational processes and driver mutation sequences of
              38 types of cancer. Early oncogenesis is characterized by
              mutations in a constrained set of driver genes, and specific copy
              number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma and isochromosome
              17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum changes
              significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40\% of samples. A
              nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased
              genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number
              alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to
              simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses

               is preceded by randomly distributed driver mutations in cancer
               genes, which cause clonal expansions in phenotypically normal
               tissues. Although clonal expansions can remodel entire
               tissues1–3, the mechanisms that result in only a small number of
               clones transforming into malignant tumours remain unknown. Here
               we develop an in vivo single-cell CRISPR strategy to
               systematically investigate tissue-wide clonal dynamics of the 150
               most frequently mutated squamous cell carcinoma genes. We couple
               ultrasound-guided in utero lentiviral microinjections,
               single-cell RNA sequencing and guide capture to longitudinally
               monitor clonal expansions and document their underlying gene
               programmes at single-cell transcriptomic resolution. We uncover a
               tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling module, which is
               dependent on TNF receptor 1 and involving macrophages, that acts
               as a generalizable driver of clonal expansions in epithelial
               tissues. Conversely, during tumorigenesis, the TNF signalling
               module is downregulated. Instead, we identify a subpopulation of
               invasive cancer cells that switch to an autocrine TNF gene
               programme associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition.
               Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that the autocrine TNF gene
               programme is sufficient to mediate invasive properties and show
               that the TNF signature correlates with shorter overall survival
               of patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, our study
               demonstrates the power of applying in vivo single-cell CRISPR
               screening to mammalian tissues, unveils distinct TNF programmes
               in tumour evolution and highlights the importance of
               understanding the relationship between clonal expansions in
               epithelia and tumorigenesis. A CRISPR-based strategy for
               screening genes that affect clonal expansion finds that genes
               that are frequently mutated in squamous cell carcinoma converge

              oesophageal tumours are eliminated through competition with mutant
              clones in the adjacent normal epithelium. We followed the fate of
              nascent, microscopic, pre-malignant tumours in a mouse model of

              in transgenic mice increased early tumour removal, whereas
              pharmacological inhibition of clonal competition reduced tumour

              neoplasms depends on their competitive fitness relative to that of
              mutant clones in the surrounding normal tissue. Mutant clones in
              normal epithelium have an unexpected anti-tumorigenic role in

              debated, but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations
              of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this
              issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that
              also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source
              under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to
              exploit citrate for >30,000 generations, although each population
              tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant
              finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing
              an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and
              unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement
              of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an
              ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic
              expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We
              tested these hypotheses in experiments that ``replayed'' evolution
              from different points in that population's history. We observed no
              Cit+ mutants among 8.4 x 10(12) ancestral cells, nor among 9 x
              10(12) cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000
              generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency
              for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating
              mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change
              increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized
              hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was
              contingent on the particular history of that population. More
              generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially
              important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations
              that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.",

               processes is a central goal of evolutionary biology. Direct
               insights into the extent and causes of evolutionary contingency
               have been limited to experimental systems, because it is
               difficult to know what happened in the deep past and to
               characterize other paths that evolution could have followed. Here
               we combine ancestral protein reconstruction, directed evolution
               and biophysical analysis to explore alternative 'might-have-been'
               trajectories during the ancient evolution of a novel protein
               function. We previously found that the evolution of cortisol
               specificity in the ancestral glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was
               contingent on permissive substitutions, which had no apparent
               effect on receptor function but were necessary for GR to tolerate
               the large-effect mutations that caused the shift in specificity.
               Here we show that alternative mutations that could have permitted
               the historical function-switching substitutions are extremely
               rare in the ensemble of genotypes accessible to the ancestral GR.
               In a library of thousands of variants of the ancestral protein,
               we recovered historical permissive substitutions but no
               alternative permissive genotypes. Using biophysical analysis, we
               found that permissive mutations must satisfy at least three
               physical requirements--they must stabilize specific local
               elements of the protein structure, maintain the correct energetic
               balance between functional conformations, and be compatible with
               the ancestral and derived structures--thus revealing why
               permissive mutations are rare. These findings demonstrate that GR
               evolution depended strongly on improbable, non-deterministic
               events, and this contingency arose from intrinsic biophysical
               properties of the protein.",

              measured their fitness across multiple conditions. We found that
              evolution led to diverse pleiotropic fitness gains and losses,
              driven by multiple types of mutations. Approximately 60\% of this
              variation is explained by the home environment of a clone and the

              attributed to the stochastic accumulation of mutations whose

               molecular characterization of tens of thousands of primary tumors
               has solidified estimates of how frequently specific genomic
               alterations occur, identifying genetic interactions from
               co-mutation rates alone remains limited by the vast number of
               possible combinations as well as inherent biases and confounding
               effects. Conversely, genetically engineered mouse models can
               reliably uncover causal effects of specific genetic alterations
               but are not sufficiently high throughput to generate broad
               insights into the interplay between genetic alterations in
               tumors. Therefore, how the effects of one alteration on tumor
               growth change in the context of other alterations remains largely
               unknown. We previously addressed these technical limitations by
               combining CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, tumor barcoding, and
               ultra-deep barcode sequencing methods with genetically engineered
               mouse models of human lung cancer, which together enable
               multiplexing of tumor genotypes in individual mice and precise,
               high-throughput quantification of in vivo tumor fitness. Here, we
               leverage this platform to systematically quantify the growth
               effects of over 45 known and putative tumor suppressor gene
               alterations across different common oncogenic point mutations in
               Kras and Braf. While the set of genes we identified as tumor
               suppressive in KrasG12D- and KrasG12C-driven lung cancers was
               largely consistent, inactivation of those genes typically
               resulted in larger tumor growth advantages in the KrasG12D model.
               Inactivation of most genes in BrafV600E-driven lung tumors had a
               strikingly different growth effect than in tumors with either
               Kras variant, and effects were generally far less pronounced in
               the BrafV600E context. Interestingly, loss of genes upstream of
               Braf within the Ras pathway often had strong effects in the
               KrasG12D or KrasG12C models—loss of Nf1, a negative regulator of
               Kras, or loss of the wildtype Kras allele enhanced oncogenic
               Kras-driven tumor growth, while loss of Shp2, a positive
               regulator of Kras, was mildly detrimental—but had little or no
               effects in the BrafV600E model. We assessed translatability of
               our experimental cause-and-effect data through comparisons to
               correlative data from publicly available human lung cancer
               genomics databases, and found that genetic interactions predicted
               by our models and gene co-mutation rates in patient tumors
               largely align. Together, these findings underscore the need for a
               contextual understanding of the ways in which tumors are
               influenced by their genetics and highlight the utility of
               high-throughput, quantitative autochthonous mouse models in

               modeling and human validation, we have identified a conserved
               stress-like state that confers intrinsic drug resistance and is
               associated with poor patient survival. Single cell sequencing of
               a series of transgenic zebrafish melanoma tumors revealed 3
               distinct cell states that correspond to a neural crest,
               melanocyte or stress-like state. The existence of these 3 states
               was confirmed using spatial transcriptomics, a method that does
               not require tissue dissociation or cell sorting. The stress-like
               state expresses genes such as fos, hsp70 and ubb, proteins which
               are all required for adaptation to diverse cellular stresses. A
               transgenic reporter of the stress like state demonstrates that it
               has higher tumor seeding capabilities compared to non-stressed
               cells, and confers intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibitors, a
               commonly used melanoma therapeutic. The stress program can be
               induced by extrinsic processes such as heat shock, and confers
               resistance to MEK inhibitors in both zebrafish and human
               melanomas. Our study identifies a population of stress-like cells
               that are present from the time of tumor initiation, suggesting
               that the transcriptional seeds of therapeutic failure are
               established during the earliest steps of tumorigenesis. Citation

               is greatly enhanced by studying tumors from multiple species. A
               comparison of tumors between evolutionarily distant organisms
               such as humans and fish offers a particularly powerful method to
               identify such core functionalities. In the past several years,
               the zebrafish has emerged as an important vertebrate model of
               cancer because it develops tumors that are histologically and
               functionally similar to the human disease. Overexpression of the
               BRAFV600E oncogene under the melanocyte-specific mitf promoter
               leads to a 100\% penetrant melanoma in the context of p53 loss of
               function. We have previously shown that these zebrafish tumors
               exhibit characteristics of neural crest progenitors, rather than
               differentiated melanocytes, similar to many human melanomas which
               also overexpress the neural crest markers sox10 and ednrb. To
               identify the genomic lesions that are common to both species, we
               are performing RNA and DNA-sequencing of the zebrafish tumors and
               comparing them to human melanoma resequencing samples to identify
               common driver events. To facilitate this, we have developed
               technologies for both short and long term culture of zebrafish
               melanoma cell lines, along with normal tissue from each
               individual animal. One such melanoma line, ZMEL1, has been
               comprehensively characterized. RNA-seq demonstrated upregulation
               of neural crest genes such as ednrb, and pathway analysis
               indicated enrichment for ERK/MAP kinase and PI3K/AKT signaling
               pathways, and these tumors are sensitive to inhibition by the
               BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was
               performed on tumor cell line and matched normal tissue to a depth
               of 39X coverage on the Illumina platform. A total of 5193 single
               basepair mutations were identified, of which 2\% were found in
               the coding region, 41\% in intronic regions and 56\% in the
               intergenic DNA. Within the coding region, 25\% were G>C and 18\%
               T>C substitutions, with approximately equal number of
               non-synonymous to silent mutations. Coding mutations in several
               genes such as rps6kb1b and plb1 are of particular interest
               because of their reported mutation in human cancer as well. 35
               regions of copy number changes were found, comprising over 600
               genes, and these include amplification of known oncogenes such as
               SETDB1. Functional analysis of the genomic changes common to both
               zebrafish and human tumors is now being undertaken using in vitro
               and in vivo melanoma models. In summary, comparative oncogenomics
               between zebrafish and human melanoma provides a powerful method
               for filtering the vast number of changes down to a list of
               manageable, testable hypotheses. This method can be broadly
               applied to other tumors types. Citation Format: Richard M. White,

              differences in rare individual cells in the initial population

              comparatively little is known about variability in the resistant

              exposed to anti-cancer therapies. We show that resistant clones

              morphologically, and functionally distinct fate types. These
              different resistant types are largely predetermined by molecular

               expression is a major event leading to neovascularization in
               malignant gliomas. Hypoxia is believed to be the crucial
               environmental stimulus for this up-regulation. To critically
               assess this hypothesis, we asked whether the mechanisms defined
               previously for hypoxia-induced VEGF expression in vitro are
               similarly involved and sufficient for up-regulation of VEGF gene
               expression in vivo, using a lacZ reporter gene under the control
               of VEGF regulatory sequences in an experimental glioma model.
               Inclusion of the binding site for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF
               1) in the 5' regulatory sequences used in the hybrid gene
               produced weak beta-galactosidase staining in a special tumor cell
               subtype, the so-called perinecrotic palisading (PNP) cells that
               flank necrotic regions within the tumor. Deletion of the HIF 1
               binding site abolished reporter gene expression in the PNP cells,
               indicating that transcriptional activation of VEGF expression in
               gliomas is mediated by HIF 1. Inclusion of 3' untranslated
               sequences from the VEGF gene in the reporter constructs resulted
               in an increased beta-galactosidase staining in the PNP cells,
               suggesting that mRNA stabilization also contributes to VEGF
               up-regulation in glioblastoma cells growing as solid tumors.
               Combination of the 5' flanking region including the HIF 1 site
               along with 3' untranslated sequences produced increased levels of
               beta-galactosidase expression in PNP cells. EF 5 immunostaining
               for regions of low oxygen partial pressure covered the same PNP
               cells that were stained for beta-galactosidase. Collectively, the
               data provide experimental evidence that VEGF gene expression is
               activated in a distinct tumor cell subpopulation, the
               perinecrotic palisading cells of gliomas, by two distinct

              therapy. Some tumors undergo EMT while others do not, which may
              reflect intrinsic properties of their cell of origin. However,
              this possibility is largely unexplored. By targeting the same
              oncogenic mutations to discrete skin compartments, we show that
              cell-type-specific chromatin and transcriptional states

              (SCCs) derived from interfollicular epidermis (IFE) are generally
              well differentiated, while hair follicle (HF) stem cell-derived
              SCCs frequently exhibit EMT, efficiently form secondary tumors,
              and possess increased metastatic potential. Transcriptional and
              epigenomic profiling revealed that IFE and HF tumor-initiating
              cells possess distinct chromatin landscapes and gene regulatory

              increasingly logical science, and the provisional new dimensions

               1950s–1970s and became central to cancer biology in the
               twenty-first century, largely through studies of cancer genetics.
               Although it has proven its worth, its structure has been
               challenged by observations of phenotypic plasticity, non-genetic
               forms of inheritance, non-genetic determinants of clone fitness
               and non-tree-like transmission of genes. There is even confusion
               about the definition of a clone, which we aim to resolve. The
               performance and value of the clonal evolution model depends on
               the empirical extent to which evolutionary processes are involved
               in cancer, and on its theoretical ability to account for those
               evolutionary processes. Here, we identify limits in the
               theoretical performance of the clonal evolution model and provide
               solutions to overcome those limits. Although we do not claim that
               clonal evolution can explain everything about cancer, we show how
               many of the complexities that have been identified in the
               dynamics of cancer can be integrated into the model to improve
               our current understanding of cancer. Clonal evolution is now a
               central theoretical framework in cancer research. In this
               Perspective, Laplane and Maley identify challenges to that theory
               such that some non-evolutionary phenomena in cancer cannot be
               captured by the theory. They also outline how other challenges,
               including non-genetic heredity, phenotypic plasticity, reticulate

               but how p53 suppresses LUAD development remains enigmatic. We
               show here that p53 suppresses LUAD by governing cell state,
               specifically by promoting alveolar type 1 (AT1) differentiation.
               Using mice that express oncogenic Kras and null, wild-type or
               hypermorphic Trp53 alleles in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, we
               observed graded effects of p53 on LUAD initiation and
               progression. RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing of LUAD cells
               uncovered a p53-induced AT1 differentiation programme during
               tumour suppression in vivo through direct DNA binding, chromatin
               remodelling and induction of genes characteristic of AT1 cells.
               Single-cell transcriptomics analyses revealed that during LUAD
               evolution, p53 promotes AT1 differentiation through action in a
               transitional cell state analogous to a transient intermediary
               seen during AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation in alveolar injury
               repair. Notably, p53 inactivation results in the inappropriate
               persistence of these transitional cancer cells accompanied by
               upregulated growth signalling and divergence from lung lineage
               identity, characteristics associated with LUAD progression.
               Analysis of Trp53 wild-type and Trp53-null mice showed that p53
               also directs alveolar regeneration after injury by regulating AT2
               cell self-renewal and promoting transitional cell differentiation
               into AT1 cells. Collectively, these findings illuminate
               mechanisms of p53-mediated LUAD suppression, in which p53 governs
               alveolar differentiation, and suggest that tumour suppression
               reflects a fundamental role of p53 in orchestrating tissue repair
               after injury.",

              how genetically distinct subclones grow and evolve spatially. We
              observed a phenotype of advanced and more aggressive subclonal

               in evolutionary biology. Pleiotropy, i.e. the effect of an allele
               on multiple traits, is thought to enhance repeatability by
               constraining the number of available beneficial mutations.
               Additionally, pleiotropy may promote repeatability by allowing
               large fitness benefits of single mutations via adaptive
               combinations of phenotypic effects. Yet, this latter evolutionary
               potential may be reaped solely by specific types of mutations
               able to realize optimal combinations of phenotypic effects while
               avoiding the costs of pleiotropy. Here, we address the
               interaction of gene pleiotropy and mutation type on evolutionary
               repeatability in a meta-analysis of experimental evolution
               studies with Escherichia coli. We hypothesize that single
               nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are principally able to yield
               large fitness benefits by targeting highly pleiotropic genes,
               whereas indels and structural variants (SVs) provide smaller
               benefits and are restricted to genes with lower pleiotropy. By
               using gene connectivity as proxy for pleiotropy, we show that
               non-disruptive SNPs in highly pleiotropic genes yield the largest
               fitness benefits, since they contribute more to parallel
               evolution, especially in large populations, than inactivating
               SNPs, indels and SVs. Our findings underscore the importance of

               Consequently, it is becoming increasingly apparent that
               pluripotent cells can compare their fitness levels and signal the
               elimination of those cells that are less fit than their

               in the early mouse embryo and upon exit from naive pluripotency,
               the confrontation of cells with different fitness levels leads to
               an inhibition of mTOR signalling in the less fit cell type,

               programs attributable to the cell type of origin. In one model,
               tumors gain metastatic ability through amplification of the
               transcription factor NFIB and a widespread increase in chromatin
               accessibility, whereas in the other model, tumors become

              and gradual process. In particular, the mutations that drive
              evolution are predicted to be small and modular, incrementally
              improving a small number of traits. However, adaptive mutations
              identified early in microbial evolution experiments, cancer, and
              other systems often provide substantial fitness gains and
              pleiotropically improve multiple traits at once. We asked whether
              such pleiotropically adaptive mutations are common throughout
              adaptation or are instead a rare feature of early steps in
              evolution that tend to target key signaling pathways. To do so, we
              conducted barcoded second-step evolution experiments initiated
              from five first-step mutations identified from a prior yeast
              evolution experiment. We then isolated hundreds of second-step
              mutations from these evolution experiments, measured their fitness
              and performance in several growth phases, and conducted
              whole-genome sequencing of the second-step clones. Here, we found
              that while the vast majority of mutants isolated from the
              first-step of evolution in this condition show patterns of
              pleiotropic adaptation - improving both performance in
              fermentation and respiration growth phases - second-step mutations
              show a shift towards modular adaptation, mostly improving
              respiration performance and only rarely improving fermentation
              performance. We also identified a shift in the molecular basis of
              adaptation from genes in cellular signaling pathways towards genes
              involved in respiration and mitochondrial function. Our results
              suggest that the genes in cellular signaling pathways are
              particularly capable of providing large, adaptively pleiotropic
              benefits to the organism due to their ability to coherently affect
              many phenotypes at once. As such, these genes may serve as the
              source of pleiotropic adaptation in the early stages of evolution,
              and once these become exhausted, organisms then adapt more
              gradually, acquiring smaller, more modular mutations.",

              evolution and occur when, for example, resistance to one drug
              results in sensitivity to another. Major questions remain about
              the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically, whether
              the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer
              similar tradeoffs. This question is difficult because the
              drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic, and even those
              evolved in controlled laboratory settings, are often biased
              towards those that provide large fitness benefits. Thus, the
              mutations (and mechanisms) that provide drug resistance may be
              more diverse than current data suggests. Here, we perform
              evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a
              fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness

              imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different
              underlying mechanisms. Some of the groupings we find are
              surprising. For example, we find some mutants that resist single
              drugs do not resist their combination, and some mutants to the
              same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings, on
              one hand, demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or
              intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. On the
              other hand, by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations
              can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs, our
              findings empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to
              combat resistance. Finally, by grouping mutants that likely affect
              fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, our work guides
              efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation.",

                 understood about how genes interact with each other to enable

                 investigating genetic interactions in a high-throughput and
                 multiplexed manner. Here, we employed a novel platform to
                 generate tumors with all pairwise inactivation of ten tumor
                 suppressor genes within an autochthonous mouse model of
                 oncogenic KRAS-driven lung cancer. By quantifying the fitness
                 of tumors with every single and double mutant genotype, we show
                 that most tumor suppressor genetic interactions exhibited
                 negative epistasis, with diminishing returns on tumor fitness.
                 In contrast, Apc inactivation showed positive epistasis with

               Inducible ablation of Notch1 in the cornea combined with

               However, in epidermal hyperproliferative disorders and tumors,
               integrins are also expressed by suprabasal cells, with
               concomitant up-regulation of Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase
               (MAPK) signaling. In transgenic mice, expression of activated
               MAPK kinase 1 (MEK1) in the suprabasal, nondividing,
               differentiated cell layers (InvEE transgenics) results in
               epidermal hyperproliferation and skin inflammation. We now
               demonstrate that wounding induces benign tumors (papillomas and
               keratoacanthomas) in InvEE mice. By generating chimeras between
               InvEE mice and mice that lack the MEK1 transgene, we demonstrate

                 cellular and molecular events within the initial preneoplastic
                 cell (PNC) niche that might determine the outcome of PNC
                 development. Here, we combine in vivo live imaging and single
                 cell transcriptomics to investigate the immediate cellular and
                 molecular changes that occur in PNCs and responding innate
                 immune cells within the first 24 hours following tumour
                 initiation. We do so using an inducible transgenic zebrafish
                 model of tumour initiation, in which oncogenic HRAS is
                 conditionally expressed within the zebrafish epidermis. We
                 found that, when expressed within basal keratinocytes,
                 oncogenic HRAS was sufficient to drive several cancer hallmarks
                 in nascent PNCs and their niche. Within 8 hours of oncogenic
                 HRAS induction, basal keratinocytes began to dedifferentiate,
                 followed by a bifurcation in PNC fate towards either a cellular
                 state characterised by partial
                 Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (pEMT) and cancer stem cell
                 features or a more differentiated cell state resembling
                 suprabasal keratinocytes. By directly integrating data from
                 PNCs and human SCC patients we show that both of these PNC
                 states likely persist with established tumours, whilst the pEMT
                 state corresponded with a more aggressive phenotype.
                 Strikingly, markers of the PNC subpopulation that underwent
                 pEMT correlated with poor prognosis in multiple human cancer
                 types in the TCGA database. In addition, the pEMT PNC
                 subpopulation expressed higher levels of cytokines that
                 modulate neutrophil development and function, suggesting a
                 major role for these cells in governing pro-tumour neutrophil
                 responses. Indeed, we found that granulopoiesis was altered
                 within PNC-bearing larvae, with a large proportion of
                 neutrophils switching to an Arginase 2 positive phenotype that

               Recently, Rb-mediated silencing of growth-promoting genes by
               heterochromatin formation associated with methylation of histone
               H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) was identified as a critical feature of
               cellular senescence, which may depend on the histone
               methyltransferase Suv39h1. Here we show that Emicro-N-Ras
               transgenic mice harbouring targeted heterozygous lesions at the
               Suv39h1, or the p53 locus for comparison, succumb to invasive
               T-cell lymphomas that lack expression of Suv39h1 or p53,
               respectively. By contrast, most N-Ras-transgenic wild-type
               ('control') animals develop a non-lymphoid neoplasia
               significantly later. Proliferation of primary lymphocytes is
               directly stalled by a Suv39h1-dependent, H3K9me-related senescent
               growth arrest in response to oncogenic Ras, thereby cancelling
               lymphomagenesis at an initial step. Suv39h1-deficient lymphoma
               cells grow rapidly but, unlike p53-deficient cells, remain highly
               susceptible to adriamycin-induced apoptosis. In contrast, only
               control, but not Suv39h1-deficient or p53-deficient, lymphomas
               senesce after drug therapy when apoptosis is blocked. These

              emergence of resistant cancer cells is a major barrier to full
              cures. Resistance can result from secondary mutations, but in
              other cases there is no clear genetic cause, raising the
              possibility of non-genetic rare cell variability. Here we show

              resistance markers at high levels in a very small percentage of
              cells. The addition of drug then induces epigenetic reprogramming
              in these cells, converting the transient transcriptional state to
              a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins with a loss of

              susceptible, suggesting that our knowledge of the full spectrum of

              susceptible subsets of cells within a population may reveal
              additional factors that promote infection. However, because viral

               both populations after 20,000 generations. The expression of 59
               genes had changed significantly in both populations. Remarkably,
               all 59 were changed in the same direction relative to the
               ancestor. Many of these genes were members of the cAMP-cAMP

               modifications, elevated macromolecular damage, metabolism

               The initial demonstration of oncogene‐induced senescence in vitro
               established senescence as an important tumour‐suppressive
               mechanism, in addition to apoptosis. Senescence not only halts
               the proliferation of premalignant cells but also facilitates the
               clearance of affected cells through immunosurveillance. Failure
               to clear senescent cells owing to deficient immunosurveillance
               may, however, lead to a state of chronic inflammation that
               nurtures a pro‐tumorigenic microenvironment favouring cancer
               initiation, migration and metastasis. In addition, senescence is
               a response to post‐therapy genotoxic stress. Therefore, tracking
               the emergence of senescent cells becomes pivotal to detect
               potential pro‐tumorigenic events. Current protocols for the in
               vivo detection of senescence require the analysis of fixed or
               deep‐frozen tissues, despite a significant clinical need for
               real‐time bioimaging methods. Accuracy and efficiency of
               senescence detection are further hampered by a lack of universal
               and more specific senescence biomarkers. Recently, in an attempt
               to overcome these hurdles, an assortment of detection tools has

              selection disfavoring certain parts of the morphospace. The extent
              to which developmental bias, the tendency of certain phenotypes to
              preferentially appear as potential variation, also explains these
              patterns is hotly debated. Here we demonstrate quantitatively that
              developmental bias is the primary explanation for the occupation
              of the morphospace of RNA secondary structure (SS) shapes. Upon
              random mutations, some RNA SS shapes (the frequent ones) are much
              more likely to appear than others. By using the RNAshapes method
              to define coarse-grained SS classes, we can directly compare the
              frequencies that noncoding RNA SS shapes appear in the RNAcentral
              database to frequencies obtained upon a random sampling of
              sequences. We show that: 1) only the most frequent structures
              appear in nature; the vast majority of possible structures in the
              morphospace have not yet been explored; 2) remarkably small
              numbers of random sequences are needed to produce all the RNA SS
              shapes found in nature so far; and 3) perhaps most surprisingly,
              the natural frequencies are accurately predicted, over several
              orders of magnitude in variation, by the likelihood that
              structures appear upon a uniform random sampling of sequences. The
              ultimate cause of these patterns is not natural selection, but
              rather a strong phenotype bias in the RNA genotype-phenotype map,
              a type of developmental bias or ``findability constraint,'' which
              limits evolutionary dynamics to a hugely reduced subset of

              with constant and uniform conditions, often proceeds via
              large-effect beneficial mutations that may become maladaptive in
              other environments. Conversely, natural settings require
              populations to endure environmental fluctuations. A sensible
              assumption is that the fitness of a lineage in a fluctuating
              environment is the time-average of its fitness over the sequence
              of static conditions it encounters. However, transitions between
              conditions may pose entirely new challenges, which could cause
              deviations from this time-average. To test this, we tracked
              hundreds of thousands of barcoded yeast lineages evolving in
              static and fluctuating conditions and subsequently isolated 900
              mutants for pooled fitness assays in 15 environments. We find that
              fitness in fluctuating environments indeed often deviates from the
              expectation based on static components, leading to fitness
              non-additivity. Moreover, closer examination reveals that fitness
              in one component of a fluctuating environment is often strongly
              influenced by the previous component. We show that this
              environmental memory is especially common for mutants with high
              variance in fitness across tested environments, even if the
              components of the focal fluctuating environment are excluded from
              this variance. We employ a simple mathematical model and
              whole-genome sequencing to propose mechanisms underlying this

              results demonstrate that environmental fluctuations have large

               combinations of gene mutations or the distinct regulatory
               pathways for inducing the progression of tumor. Investigating the
               pathways of gene mutations which can cause the formation of tumor
               can provide a basis for the personalized treatment of cancer.
               Studies suggested that KRAS, APC and TP53 are the most
               significant driver genes for colorectal cancer. However, it is
               still an open issue regarding the detailed mutation order of
               these genes in the development of colorectal cancer. For this
               purpose, we analyze the mathematical model considering all orders
               of mutations in oncogene, KRAS and tumor suppressor genes, APC
               and TP53, and fit it on data describing the incidence rates of

               the year 1973–2013. The specific orders that can induce the

               with KRAS → APC → TP53, APC → TP53 → KRAS and APC → KRAS → TP53
               explain the age–specific risk of colorectal cancer with very
               well. Furthermore, eleven pathways of gene mutations can be
               accepted for the mutation order of genes with KRAS → APC → TP53,
               APC → TP53 → KRAS and APC → KRAS → TP53, and the alternation of
               APC acts as the initiating or promoting event in the colorectal
               cancer. The estimated mutation rates of cells in the different

              objective in evolutionary biology. A standard approach for
              measuring microbial fitnesses in bulk involves labeling a library
              of genetic variants with unique sequence barcodes, competing the
              labeled strains in batch culture, and using deep sequencing to
              track changes in the barcode abundances over time. However,
              idiosyncratic properties of barcodes (e.g., GC content) can induce
              non-uniform amplification or uneven sequencing coverage that cause
              some barcodes to be over- or under-represented in samples. This
              systematic bias can result in erroneous read count trajectories

              localized interactions, generate electro-chemical gradients, and
              help in selecting cooperative functions as they arise. These
              functions pave the way for the emergence and maintenance of simple
              metabolic cycles and polymers. In the context of origin of life,
              evolution of information-carrying molecules and RNA based enzymes
              within compartments has been subject to intensive theoretical and
              experimental research. Hence, many experimental efforts aim to
              produce compartments that contain elongating polynucleotides (also

              vitro model of esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT). We found
              that individual clones possess unique growth and differentiation
              capacities, with a subset of clones growing exponentially.
              Further, we discovered that this proliferative potential for a
              clone is heritable through cell division and can be influenced by
              extrinsic cues from neighboring cells. Combining barcoding with
              single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified the cellular
              states associated with the highly proliferative clones, which
              include genes in the WNT and PI3K pathways. Importantly, we also
              identified a subset of cells resembling the highly proliferative
              cell state in the healthy human esophageal epithelium and, to a
              greater extent, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
              These findings highlight the physiological relevance of our cell
              line model, providing insights into the behavior of esophageal
              epithelial cells during homeostasis and disease. \#\#\# Competing

              found in normal tissue can contribute to tumorigenesis is limited:
              common somatic mutations may or may not confer phenotypes
              compatible with oncogenesis. However, the strength of selection
              for somatic variants that appear in both normal and cancer tissues
              can be quantified in each context using evolutionary modeling
              approaches. We studied the evolutionary trajectory from normal
              esophageal tissue to esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) by
              analysis of 2171 sequenced samples from previous studies on normal
              esophageal epithelium and ESCC to reveal the stepwise
              contributions of somatic mutations to increased cellular division

              highly selected along the trajectory from embryogenesis to adult
              normal esophageal tissue, explaining their high prevalence in the

              NOTCH1 mutations along the trajectory from adult normal tissue to
              ESCC, suggesting that NOTCH1 substitutions do not drive

              antagonistic epistasis with well-known cancer drivers including
              TP53, reducing selection for progressive mutations in

               stress, yet the phenotype provoked by lower oncogenic dosage
               remains unclear. Here we develop oncogenic RAS dose-escalation
               models in vitro and in vivo, revealing a RAS dose-driven
               non-linear continuum of downstream phenotypes. In a hepatocyte
               OIS model in vivo, ectopic expression of NRAS(G12V) does not
               induce tumours, in part owing to OIS-driven immune clearance3.

               haploinsufficient, as well as gain of function and dominant
               negative, phenotypes has caused a reevaluation of the 'two-hit'
               model of tumor suppressor inactivation. Here we examine the
               history of haploinsufficiency and tumor suppressors in order to
               understand the origin of the 'two-hit' dogma. The two-hit model
               of tumor suppressor gene inactivation was derived from
               mathematical modeling of cancer incidence. Subsequent
               interpretations implied that tumor suppressors were recessive,
               requiring mutations in both alleles. This model has provided a
               useful conceptual framework for three decades of research on the
               genetics and biology of tumor suppressor genes. Recently it has
               become clear that mutations in tumor suppressor genes are not
               always completely recessive. Haploinsufficiency occurs when one
               allele is insufficient to confer the full functionality produced
               from two wild-type alleles. Haploinsufficiency, however, is not
               an absolute property. It can be partial or complete and can vary
               depending on tissue type, other epistatic interactions, and
               environmental factors. In addition to simple quantitative
               differences (one allele versus two alleles), gene mutations can
               have qualitative differences, creating gain of function or
               dominant negative effects that can be difficult to distinguish
               from dosage-dependence. Like mutations in many other genes, tumor
               suppressor gene mutations can be haploinsufficient, dominant
               negative or gain of function in addition to recessive. Thus,
               under certain circumstances, one hit may be sufficient for
               inactivation. In addition, the phenotypic penetrance of these
               mutations can vary depending on the nature of the mutation
               itself, the genetic background, the tissue type, environmental
               factors and other variables. Incorporating these new findings
               into existing models of the clonal evolution will be a challenge

              cluster biogenesis. Puf3p, a Pumillio family protein, plays a
              pivotal role in modulating mitochondrial activity, especially
              during fermentation, by destabilizing its target mRNAs and/or by
              repressing their translation. Puf3p preferentially binds to 8-nt

              mitochondrial (nc-mitochondrial) mRNAs, leading to broad effects

              explore how Puf3p post-transcriptionally regulates
              nc-mitochondrial mRNAs in response to cell growth conditions, we
              initially focused on nc-mitochondrial mRNAs known to be enriched

              that one of the monosome-enriched mRNAs, CAT5/COQ7 mRNA, directly
              interacts with Puf3p through its non-canonical Puf3p binding
              sequence, which is generally less considered as a Puf3p binding
              site. Western blot analysis showed that Puf3p represses
              translation of Cat5p, regardless of culture in fermentable or
              respiratory medium. In vitro binding assay confirmed Puf3p's
              direct interaction with CAT5 mRNA via this non-canonical
              Puf3p-binding site. Although cat5 mutants of the non-canonical
              Puf3p-binding site grow normally, Cat5p expression is altered,
              indicating that CAT5 mRNA is a bona fide Puf3p target with
              additional regulatory factors acting through this sequence. Unlike
              other yeast PUF proteins, Puf3p uniquely regulates Cat5p by
              destabilizing mRNA and repressing translation, shedding new light
              on an unknown part of the Puf3p regulatory network. Given that
              pathological variants of human COQ7 lead to CoQ10 deficiency and

              understand the allele-specific regulation by MKT1. In oxidative
              stress, the MKT189G allele modulated the differential expression
              of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in a PBP1- and
              PUF3-dependent manner. Additionally, MKT189G stabilised Puf3
              targets, namely, COX17, MRS1 and RDL2, in an allele and
              stress-specific manner. Our results showed that COX17, MRS1 and
              RDL2 had a stress-specific response in stress environments, with
              the MKT189G allele contributing to better growth; this response
              was both PBP1- and PUF3-dependent. Our results indicate that the
              common allele, MKT189G , regulates stress responses by
              differentially stabilising Puf3-target mitochondrial genes, which
              allows for the strain's better growth in stress environments.",

              functions. Cellular modules are key units of adaptive evolution
              because organismal fitness depends on their performance. Theory
              shows that in rapidly evolving populations, such as those of many
              microbes, adaptation is driven primarily by common beneficial
              mutations with large effects, while other mutations behave as if
              they are effectively neutral. As a consequence, if a module can be
              improved only by rare and/or weak beneficial mutations, its
              adaptive evolution would stall. However, such evolutionary
              stalling has not been empirically demonstrated, and it is unclear
              to what extent stalling may limit the power of natural selection
              to improve modules. Here we empirically characterize how natural
              selection improves the translation machinery (TM), an essential
              cellular module. We experimentally evolved populations of
              Escherichia coli with genetically perturbed TMs for 1,000
              generations. Populations with severe TM defects initially adapted
              via mutations in the TM, but TM adaptation stalled within about
              300 generations. We estimate that the genetic load in our
              populations incurred by residual TM defects ranges from 0.5 to
              19\%. Finally, we found evidence that both epistasis and the

              evolutionary stalling. Our results suggest that cellular modules

              difficult task. RESULTS: Here we describe an algorithm for the
              inference of fitness effects and establishment times of beneficial
              mutations from barcode sequencing data, which builds upon a
              Bayesian inference method by enforcing self-consistency between
              the population mean fitness and the individual effects of
              mutations within lineages. By testing our inference method on a

              however, comparatively little is known about the variability in

              resistant types are largely predetermined by molecular differences

              Changes in the dose and type of drug can switch the resistant type
              of an initial cell, resulting in the generation and elimination of

              without senescent morphology, which has usually been interpreted
              as failure of p53 to induce senescence. Here we demonstrate that
              p53-induced quiescence actually results from suppression of
              senescence by p53. In previous studies, suppression of senescence
              by p53 was masked by p53-induced cell cycle arrest. Here, we
              separated these two activities by inducing senescence through
              overexpression of p21 and then testing the effect of p53 on
              senescence. We found that in p21-arrested cells, p53 converted
              senescence into quiescence. Suppression of senescence by p53
              required its transactivation function. Like rapamycin, which is
              known to suppress senescence, p53 inhibited the mTOR pathway. We
              suggest that, while inducing cell cycle arrest, p53 may
              simultaneously suppress the senescence program, thus causing
              quiescence and that suppression of senescence and induction of
              cell cycle arrest are distinct functions of p53. Thus, in spite of
              its ability to induce cell cycle arrest, p53 can act as a

               expansion of a cell clone within a multicellular organism. Since
               cancer also results from the uncontrolled proliferation of few
               cell clones, it is generally believed that aging-associated
               somatic clonal expansion observed in normal tissues represents a
               precancerous condition. For instance, hematological malignancy is
               often preceded by clonal hematopoiesis. However, the precise
               connection between cancer and somatic clonal expansion remains
               elusive in solid organs. In this study, we utilized a
               straightforward method to assess the relative quantitative
               degrees of clonal expansion in nine human organs. Our findings
               reveal that the degree of clonal expansion varies across
               different organs while remaining consistent among different
               individuals. Contrary to the general belief, we did not identify
               any significant correlation between lifetime cancer risk and the
               degree of lifetime somatic clonal expansion. For example, the
               lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is approximately 20 times
               higher than that of esophageal cancer, yet the former exhibited
               the lower degree of clonal expansion than the latter. Our results
               suggest that somatic clonal expansion represents an evolutionary

              mutations, whereas both neural crest and melanoblast populations

               pan-cancer analysis uncovers insights into the impacts of cancer

              Conversely, inducing oncogenic signals in non-transformed cells

              diversity within a tumor—is linked to a failure of immunotherapy
              in multiple cancer types and to an inferior anti-tumor immune
              response even in the absence of therapy. To determine how tumor
              heterogeneity shapes the immune microenvironment and impacts
              responses to therapy, we modeled heterogeneous tumors comprised of
              a pro-inflammatory (“hot”) and an immunosuppressive (“cold”) tumor
              population. This was done by mixing two squamous skin carcinoma
              cell lines that alone give rise to tumors with a reproducible
              immunologically “hot” or “cold” immune phenotype respectively, and
              labeling these with YFP or RFP fluorescent tags to enable precise
              spatial tracking. The resulting mixed-population tumors were made
              up of a patchwork of distinct regions that could be classified as
              being comprised of YFP+ (“hot”) cells, RFP+ (“cold”) cells, or a
              mixture of YFP+ and RFP+ cells. We find the spatial organization
              of tumor cells creates a blueprint for the spatial organization
              and functional activity of infiltrating immune cells, defining the
              architecture of both tumor-infiltrating T cell and myeloid cell
              compartments. Using a combination of microdissection techniques
              and single-cell spatial transcriptomics, we show that YFP regions
              harbor a higher frequency of Th1 cells and IFNψ+ CD8 T cells
              compared to RFP regions, whereas immunosuppressive macrophages
              preferentially accumulate in RFP regions. Total CD4 T cells were
              also enriched in YFP regions, but by contrast, total CD8 T
              cells—despite their superior function in YFP regions—were of low
              abundance throughout the heterogeneous tumors. We identify the
              chemokine Cx3cl1, produced at higher levels by our “cold” tumors,
              as a mediator of intratumoral macrophage abundance, and show that
              overexpression of Cx3cl1 in pro-inflammatory (“hot”) tumor cells
              leads to an increase in immunosuppressive CD206Hi macrophages. We
              further interrogated the impact of this spatial patterning of
              immune cells on the responses of heterogeneous tumors to
              checkpoint blockade. We find that combination of PD-1 blockade and
              CD40 agonist is able to increase the Th1 response in “cold” RFP
              regions, however the T cell response in “cold” regions remains
              inferior to “hot” regions and treatment achieves only a modest
              reduction in tumor growth. Collectively, our results demonstrate
              that the spatial organization of heterogeneous tumor cells has a
              profound impact on directing the spatial organization and function
              of tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as on responses to

              Pumilio RNA-binding domain protein Puf3 Puf3 binds to the 3'-UTR
              of many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that encode mitochondrial proteins,
              regulating their turnover, translation, and/or mitochondrial

              phosphorylation is unclear. Here, we show that the casein kinase I

              phosphorylation of Puf3 in vivo and a puf3 deletion mutation
              reverses growth defects of hrr25 mutant cells grown on medium with
              a nonfermentable carbon source. We show that Hrr25 directly
              phosphorylates Puf3, and that the interaction between Puf3 and
              Hrr25 is mediated through the N-terminal domain of Puf3 and the
              kinase domain of Hrr25 We further found that an hrr25 mutation

              3'-UTR of Puf3 targets. Downregulation of GFP expression due to an
              hrr25 mutation can be reversed either by puf3Δ or by mutations to
              the Puf3-binding sites in the 3'-UTR of the GFP reporter
              constructs. Together, our data indicate that Hrr25 is a positive

              has in common a 3'-UTR element that is bound by the Pumilio family
              protein, Puf3p, and is coordinately regulated under many

              specific growth conditions, it is challenging to determine where
              within a growth-saturation cycle those fitness gains occur. A

               for phenotypic diversification, particularly when heterogeneity
               causes populations to diverge via local adaptation. Performance
               trade-offs, such as those stemming from antagonistic pleiotropy,
               are thought to contribute to the maintenance of diversity in this
               scenario. Specifically, alleles that promote adaptation in one
               environment are expected to promote maladaptation in alternative
               environments. Contrary to this expectation, however, alleles that
               underlie locally adaptive traits often fail to exhibit fitness
               costs in alternative environments. Here, we attempt to explain
               this paradox by reviewing the results of experimental evolution
               studies, including a new one of our own, that examined the
               evolution of trade-offs during adaptation to homogeneous versus
               heterogeneous environments. We propose that when pleiotropic
               effects vary, whether or not trade-offs emerge among diverging
               populations will depend critically on ecology. For example,
               adaptation to a locally homogeneous environment is more likely to
               occur by alleles that are antagonistically pleiotropic than
               adaptation to a locally heterogeneous environment, simply because
               selection is blind to costs associated with environments that are
               not experienced locally. Our literature review confirmed the
               resulting prediction that performance trade-offs were more likely
               to evolve during selection in homogeneous than heterogeneous
               environments. The nature of the environmental heterogeneity
               (spatial versus temporal) and the length of the experiment also
               contributed in predictable ways to the likelihood that
               performance trade-offs evolved.",

              Surprisingly, experimental evolution often yields genotypes with
              improved performance in all measured traits, perhaps indicating an
              absence of trade-offs at least in the short term. Here we densely
              sample adaptive mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to ask
              whether first-step adaptive mutations result in trade-offs during
              the growth cycle. We isolated thousands of adaptive clones evolved
              under carefully chosen conditions and quantified their

              the dual control of specific induction and nitrogen source
              regulation. We have here identified UASaro, a 36-bp upstream
              element necessary and sufficient to promote transcriptional
              induction of reporter gene expression in response to tryptophan,
              phenylalanine, or tyrosine. We then isolated mutants in which
              UASaro-mediated ARO9 transcription is partially or totally
              impaired. Mutations abolishing ARO9 induction affect a gene called
              ARO80 (YDR421w), coding for a Zn2Cys6 family transcription factor.
              A sequence highly similar to UASaro was found upstream from the
              YDR380w gene encoding a homolog of bacterial indolepyruvate
              decarboxylase. In yeast, this enzyme is postulated to catalyze the

              as a major determinant of why cells respond to specific oncogenes.
              Cutaneous melanoma arises throughout the body, whereas the acral
              subtype arises on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or
              under the nails3. We sequenced the DNA of cutaneous and acral
              melanomas from a large cohort of human patients and found a
              specific enrichment for BRAF mutations in cutaneous melanoma and
              enrichment for CRKL amplifications in acral melanoma. We modelled
              these changes in transgenic zebrafish models and found that
              CRKL-driven tumours formed predominantly in the fins of the fish.
              The fins are the evolutionary precursors to tetrapod limbs,
              indicating that melanocytes in these acral locations may be
              uniquely susceptible to CRKL. RNA profiling of these fin and limb
              melanocytes, when compared with body melanocytes, revealed a
              positional identity gene programme typified by posterior HOX13
              genes. This positional gene programme synergized with CRKL to
              amplify insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling and drive
              tumours at acral sites. Abrogation of this CRKL-driven programme
              eliminated the anatomic specificity of acral melanoma. These data

              ostensibly a product of how normal cells respond to the encoded
              oncoprotein. Oncogenic mutations can impact not only the level of
              active oncoprotein, but also engagement with proteins. To attempt
              to separate these two effects, we generated four novel
              Cre-inducible (LSL) Kras alleles in mice with the biochemically
              distinct G12D or Q61R mutations and encoded by native (nat) rare
              or common (com) codons to produce low or high protein levels.
              While there were similarities, each allele also induced a distinct
              transcriptional response shortly after activation in vivo. At one
              end of the spectrum, activating the KrasLSL-natG12D allele induced
              transcriptional hallmarks suggestive of an expansion of

              Observed genetic covariance is most often interpreted in
              pleiotropic terms. In particular, functional constraints
              restricting which phenotypes are physically possible can lead to a
              stable G matrix with high genetic variance in fitness-associated
              traits, and high pleiotropic negative covariance along the
              phenotypic curve of constraint. In contrast, population genetic
              models of relative fitness assume endless adaptation without
              constraint, through a series of selective sweeps that are well
              described by recent traveling wave models. We describe the
              implications of such population genetic models for the G matrix
              when pleiotropy is excluded by design, such that all covariance
              comes from linkage disequilibrium. The G matrix is far less stable
              than has previously been found, fluctuating over the timescale of
              selective sweeps. However, its orientation is relatively stable,
              corresponding to high genetic variance in fitness-associated
              traits and strong negative covariance-the same pattern often
              interpreted in terms of pleiotropic constraints but caused instead
              by linkage disequilibrium. We find that different mechanisms drive
              the instabilities along vs. perpendicular to the fitness gradient.
              The origin of linkage disequilibrium is not drift, but small
              amounts of linkage disequilibrium are instead introduced by
              mutation and then amplified during competing selective sweeps.

              are often explained with trade-offs-the inability for one organism
              to express maximal performance in two or more environments.
              However, evidence is lacking that trade-offs are sufficient to
              explain specialists. Several lines of theoretical inquiry suggest
              that populations can specialize without explicit trade-offs, as a
              result of relaxed selection in generalists for their performance
              in rare environments. Here, I synthesize and extend these
              approaches, showing that emergent asymmetries in evolvability can
              push a population toward specialization in the absence of
              trade-offs and in the presence of substantial ecological costs of
              specialism. Simulations are used to demonstrate how adaptation to
              a more common environment interferes with adaptation to a less
              common but otherwise equal alternative environment and that this
              interference is greatly exacerbated at low recombination rates.
              This adaptive process of specialization can effectively trap
              populations in a suboptimal niche. These modeling results predict
              that transient differences in evolvability across traits during a

              studies often do not lend support for such adaptation costs. We
              test the idea that the initial fitness of the selected populations
              in the environment where the cost is estimated is key for
              interpreting tests of ecological trade-offs. We isolated single
              clones of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae every ~250
              generations from replicate experimental lineages that had been
              selected during 5000 generations in a glucose-limited environment.
              We then selected these clones in a galactose-limited environment
              for ~120 generations. Finally, we estimated single-clone fitness

              common human diseases, understanding the molecular processes
              mediating the causal variants' effect on the disease remains a
              challenge. This understanding is crucial for the development of
              therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat disease. While static
              profiling of gene expression is primarily used to get insights
              into the biological bases of diseases, it makes differentiating
              the causative from the correlative effects difficult, as the
              dynamics of the underlying biological processes are not monitored.
              Using yeast as a model, we studied genome-wide gene expression
              dynamics in the presence of a causal variant as the sole genetic
              determinant, and performed allele-specific functional validation
              to delineate the causal effects of the genetic variant on the
              phenotype. Here, we characterized the precise genetic effects of a
              functional MKT1 allelic variant in sporulation efficiency
              variation. A mathematical model describing meiotic landmark events
              and conditional activation of MKT1 expression during sporulation
              specified an early meiotic role of this variant. By analyzing the
              early meiotic genome-wide transcriptional response, we demonstrate
              an MKT1-dependent role of novel modulators, namely, RTG1/3,
              regulators of mitochondrial retrograde signaling, and DAL82,
              regulator of nitrogen starvation, in additively effecting
              sporulation efficiency. In the presence of functional MKT1 allele,
              better respiration during early sporulation was observed, which
              was dependent on the mitochondrial retrograde regulator, RTG3.
              Furthermore, our approach showed that MKT1 contributes to
              sporulation independent of Puf3, an RNA-binding protein that
              steady-state transcription profiling studies have suggested to
              mediate MKT1-pleiotropic effects during mitotic growth. These
              results uncover interesting regulatory links between meiosis and
              mitochondrial retrograde signaling. In this study, we highlight
              the advantage of analyzing allele-specific transcriptional
              dynamics of mediating genes. Applications in higher eukaryotes can
              be valuable for inferring causal molecular pathways underlying

               alternative resources is thought to be a primary cause of
               adaptive radiation. I transplanted two recently diverged
               stickleback species (Gasterosteus sp.) and their Hybrids between
               habitats to test three predictions of this hypothesis: (1) the
               form of natural selection on feeding traits should differ between
               resource environments; (2) fitness trade?offs should occur
               between morphs specialized for different resources; (3) feeding
               efficiency should be the basis of fitness differences between
               morphs. Growth rate was used as a surrogate component of fitness.
               All three predictions were upheld. The larger of the two species
               (the Benthic), which has a larger mouth, deeper body, and fewer,
               shorter gill rakers than the second species (the Limnetic), had a
               twofold growth advantage in the littoral zone of the lake. This
               pattern was reversed in the open?water habitat, where the
               Limnetic species grew at double the rate of the Benthic. Hybrids,
               which are morphologically intermediate, tended to be intermediate
               in growth in both habitats. Growth rates were closely predicted
               by earlier laboratory measurements of feeding efficiency of the
               three forms in the same habitats, thus linking growth (and
               probably fitness) with feeding performance and morphology. I
               compare the strengths of the present approach with other methods
               that have been used to test the role of resources in adaptive
               radiation. I also argue that steep trade?offs in fitness along
               the littoral?open?water habitat gradient have two further
               consequences. First, they may cause Hybrids to have low fitness,
               allowing Benthics and Limnetics to coexist in the absence of
               perfect premating isolation between them. Second, they may
               promote ecological character displacement. Steep trade?offs may
               thus help explain why divergence along the littoral?open?water
               gradient is so common in fish that have colonized low?diversity
               lakes.",

              generations, most generalist populations increased in fitness as

              demonstrating prevalent molecular adaptations. Natural evolution

              pleiotropy and hindering their fixations relative to synonymous
              mutations despite continued population adaptations. To test this

              negative regulator of the RTG pathway, acting between Rtg2p, a
              proximal sensor of mitochondrial function, and the bHLH
              transcription factors Rtg1p and Rtg3p. In mks1 Delta cells, RTG
              target gene expression is constitutive, bypassing the requirement
              for Rtg2p, and is no longer repressible by glutamate. We show
              further that Mks1p is a phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation
              pattern parallels that of Rtg3p in response to activation of the
              RTG pathway, and that Mks1p is in a complex with Rtg2p. MKS1 was
              previously implicated in the formation of [URE3], an inactive
              prion form of a negative regulator of the nitrogen catabolite
              repression pathway, Ure2p. rtg Delta mutations induce [URE3] and
              can do so independently of MKS1. We find that glutamate suppresses
              [URE3] formation, suggesting that the Mks1p effect on the
              formation of [URE3] can occur indirectly via regulation of the RTG
              pathway.",

              replicating within the cancer genome through retrotransposition,
              or presenting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to
              the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune
              system[2][2]–[5][3]. Yet, how specific repeats affect tumor
              evolution and shape the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) in a
              pro- or anti-tumorigenic manner remains poorly defined. Here, we
              integrate whole genome and total transcriptome data from a unique
              autopsy cohort of multiregional samples collected in pancreatic
              ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, into a comprehensive
              evolutionary analysis. We find that more recently evolved S hort I
              nterspersed N uclear E lements (SINE), a family of
              retrotransposable repeats, are more likely to form

              younger SINEs are strongly co-regulated with RIG-I like receptor

              pro-tumorigenic macrophage infiltration. We discover that
              immunostimulatory SINE expression in tumors is regulated by either
              L ong I nterspersed N uclear E lements 1 (LINE1/L1) mobility or

              suggest pancreatic tumors actively evolve to modulate immunogenic
              SINE stress and induce pro-tumorigenic inflammation. Our
              integrative, evolutionary analysis therefore illustrates, for the
              first time, how dark matter genomic repeats enable tumors to
              co-evolve with the TME by actively regulating viral mimicry to

              in the context of normal human skin, thus offering a glimpse into
              the genomic landscapes of individual melanocytes from human skin.
              As expected, sun-shielded melanocytes had fewer mutations than
              sun-exposed melanocytes. However, melanocytes from chronically
              sun-exposed skin (for example, the face) had a lower mutation
              burden than melanocytes from intermittently sun-exposed skin (for
              example, the back). Melanocytes located adjacent to a skin cancer
              had higher mutation burdens than melanocytes from donors without
              skin cancer, implying that the mutation burden of normal skin can
              be used to measure cumulative sun damage and risk of skin cancer.
              Moreover, melanocytes from healthy skin commonly contained

              the origins and consequences of tissue architecture during
              tumorigenesis remain elusive. In skin, premalignant basal cell
              carcinomas form 'buds', while invasive squamous cell carcinomas

              manipulations and biophysical measurements, we identify the
              biophysical underpinnings and biological consequences of these
              tumour architectures. Cell proliferation and actomyosin
              contractility dominate tissue architectures in monolayer, but not

              softening and enhanced remodelling of the basement membrane

              conserved in all eukaryotes, which engulfs cytoplasmic components
              within double-membrane vesicles to allow their delivery to, and
              subsequent degradation within, the vacuole/lysosome. Autophagy
              activity is tightly regulated in response to the nutritional state
              of the cell and also to maintain organelle homeostasis. In
              nutrient-rich conditions, Tor kinase complex 1 (TORC1) is
              activated to inhibit autophagy, whereas inactivation of this
              complex in response to stress leads to autophagy induction;
              however, it is unclear how the activity of TORC1 is controlled to
              allow precise adjustments in autophagy activity. In this study, we
              performed genetic analyses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify
              factors that regulate TORC1 activity. We determined that the Ksp1
              kinase functions in part as a negative regulator of autophagy;
              deletion of KSP1 facilitated dephosphorylation of Atg13, a TORC1
              substrate, which correlates with enhanced autophagy. These results
              suggest that Ksp1 down-regulates autophagy activity via the TORC1
              pathway. The suppressive function of Ksp1 is partially activated
              by the Ras/cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which is another
              negative regulator of autophagy. Our study therefore identifies
              Ksp1 as a new component that functions as part of the PKA and
              TORC1 signaling network to control the magnitude of autophagy.",

              how spatial position governs tumour cell division remains
              difficult to evaluate in clinical tumours. Here, we demonstrate
              that faster division on the tumour periphery leaves characteristic
              genetic patterns, which become evident when a phylogenetic tree is
              reconstructed from spatially sampled cells. Namely, rapidly
              dividing peripheral lineages branch more extensively and acquire
              more mutations than slower-dividing centre lineages. We develop a
              Bayesian state-dependent evolutionary phylodynamic model (SDevo)
              that quantifies these patterns to infer the differential division
              rates between peripheral and central cells. We demonstrate that
              this approach accurately infers spatially varying birth rates of
              simulated tumours across a range of growth conditions and sampling
              strategies. We then show that SDevo outperforms state-of-the-art,

               implicate the transcriptome as a major source of phenotypic
               variation. Gene expression levels and ITH relate to patterns of

               Allele-specific expression can also result in

              accumulation of mutations which can have a range of unrealized
              pleiotropic effects in other environments. These pleiotropic
              consequences of adaptation can influence the emergence of
              specialists or generalists, and are critical for evolution in
              temporally or spatially fluctuating environments. While many
              experiments have examined the pleiotropic effects of adaptation at
              a snapshot in time, very few have observed the dynamics by which
              these effects emerge and evolve. Here, we propagated hundreds of
              diploid and haploid laboratory budding yeast populations in each
              of three environments, and then assayed their fitness in multiple
              environments over 1000 generations of evolution. We find that
              replicate populations evolved in the same condition share common
              patterns of pleiotropic effects across other environments, which
              emerge within the first several hundred generations of evolution.
              However, we also find dynamic and environment-specific variability
              within these trends: variability in pleiotropic effects tends to
              increase over time, with the extent of variability depending on
              the evolution environment. These results suggest shifting and
              overlapping contributions of chance and contingency to the

              which the clonal expansion rate has been assessed by longitudinal
              sampling. Here, to circumvent this limitation, we developed a
              method to infer the expansion rate from data from a single time
              point. We applied this method to 5,071 people with clonal
              haematopoiesis. A genome-wide association study revealed that a
              common inherited polymorphism in the TCL1A promoter was associated

              The protective allele restricted TCL1A expression and expansion of
              mutant HSCs, as did experimental knockdown of TCL1A expression.
              Forced expression of TCL1A promoted the expansion of human HSCs in

              cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Although classical models
              based on genetic data predominantly propose Darwinian mechanisms
              of cancer evolution, recent single-cell profiling of cancers has
              described unprecedented heterogeneity in tumors providing support
              for alternative models of branched and neutral evolution through
              both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms. Emerging evidence points
              to a complex interplay between genetic, non-genetic, and extrinsic
              environmental factors in shaping the evolution of tumors (Figure

              cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape clonal behaviors

              subpopulations-or subclones-of cells. These subclones can
              influence neighboring clones in a process called ``clonal
              interaction.'' Conventionally, research on driver mutations in
              cancer has focused on their cell-autonomous effects that lead to
              an increase in fitness of the cells containing the driver.
              Recently, with the advent of improved experimental and
              computational technologies for investigating tumor heterogeneity
              and clonal dynamics, new studies have shown the importance of
              clonal interactions in cancer initiation, progression, and
              metastasis. In this review we provide an overview of clonal
              interactions in cancer, discussing key discoveries from a diverse
              range of approaches to cancer biology research. We discuss common
              types of clonal interactions, such as cooperation and competition,
              its mechanisms, and the overall effect on tumorigenesis, with
              important implications for tumor heterogeneity, resistance to
              treatment, and tumor suppression. Quantitative models-in
              coordination with cell culture and animal model experiments-have
              played a vital role in investigating the nature of clonal
              interactions and the complex clonal dynamics they generate. We
              present mathematical and computational models that can be used to
              represent clonal interactions and provide examples of the roles
              they have played in identifying and quantifying the strength of
              clonal interactions in experimental systems. Clonal interactions
              have proved difficult to observe in clinical data; however,
              several very recent quantitative approaches enable their
              detection. We conclude by discussing ways in which researchers can
              further integrate quantitative methods with experimental and
              clinical data to elucidate the critical-and often surprising-roles
              of clonal interactions in human cancers.",

              true for pancreatic cancers, where most patients are diagnosed
              with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to
              chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Whether the dismal prognosis of
              patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with other
              types of cancer is a result of late diagnosis or early
              dissemination of disease to distant organs is not known. Here we
              rely on data generated by sequencing the genomes of seven
              pancreatic cancer metastases to evaluate the clonal relationships
              among primary and metastatic cancers. We find that clonal
              populations that give rise to distant metastases are represented
              within the primary carcinoma, but these clones are genetically
              evolved from the original parental, non-metastatic clone. Thus,

               engineering, we still lack scalable approaches that are
               applicable to the important setting of primary cells, such as
               blood and immune cells. Here, we describe the development of
               massively parallel base-editing screens in human hematopoietic
               stem and progenitor cells. Such approaches enable functional
               screens for variant effects across any hematopoietic
               differentiation state. Moreover, they allow for rich phenotyping
               through single-cell RNA sequencing readouts and separately for
               characterization of editing outcomes through pooled single-cell
               genotyping. We efficiently design improved leukemia immunotherapy
               approaches, comprehensively identify non-coding variants
               modulating fetal hemoglobin expression, define mechanisms
               regulating hematopoietic differentiation, and probe the
               pathogenicity of uncharacterized disease-associated variants.
               These strategies will advance effective and high-throughput

              for modern medicine from infectious diseases to cancers. Many of
              these resistance-conferring mutations often carry a substantial
              fitness cost in the absence of treatment. As a result, we would
              expect these mutants to undergo purifying selection and be rapidly
              driven to extinction. Nevertheless, pre-existing resistance is
              frequently observed from drug-resistant malaria to targeted cancer
              therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma.
              Solutions to this apparent paradox have taken several forms from
              spatial rescue to simple mutation supply arguments. Recently, in
              an evolved resistant NSCLC cell line, we found that
              frequency-dependent ecological interactions between ancestor and
              mutant ameliorate the cost of resistance in the absence of
              treatment. Here, we hypothesize that frequency-dependent
              ecological interactions in general may play a major role in the
              prevalence of pre-existing resistance. We combine numerical
              simulations with robust analytical approximations to provide a
              rigorous mathematical framework for studying the effects of
              frequency-dependent ecological interactions on the evolutionary
              dynamics of pre-existing resistance. First, we find that
              ecological interactions significantly expand the parameter regime
              under which we expect to observe pre-existing resistance. Even
              when positive ecological interactions between mutants and
              ancestors are rare, these clones provide the primary mode of
              evolved resistance because their positive interaction leads to
              significantly longer extinction times. Next, we find that even in
              the case where mutation supply is sufficient to predict
              pre-existing resistance, frequency-dependent ecological forces
              still contribute a strong evolutionary pressure that selects for
              increasingly positive ecological effects. Finally, we genetically
              engineer several of the most common clinically observed resistance
              mechanisms to targeted therapies in NSCLC, a treatment notorious
              for pre-existing resistance, and where our theory predicts
              positive ecological interactions to be common. We find that all
              three engineered mutants display a positive ecological interaction
              with their ancestor, as predicted. Strikingly, as with our
              originally evolved resistant mutant, two of the three engineered
              mutants have ecological interactions that fully compensate for
              their substantial fitness costs. As a whole, these results suggest
              that frequency-dependent ecological effects may provide the
              primary mode by which pre-existing resistance emerges. \#\#\#

              tumor-cell subpopulations could be an additional catalyst of
              progression. Using a zebrafish-melanoma xenograft model, we found

              switch from protease-independent to an MT1-MMP-dependent mode of
              invasion. We did not observe changes in expression of the melanoma
              phenotype determinant MITF during cooperative invasion, thus
              ruling out the necessity for phenotype switching for invasion.

              unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to
              15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to
              provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary

              quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key
              driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are
              typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood
              remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones
              subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which
              confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early
              drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver
              mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades
              before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML.
              Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations

              competition between lineages with limited evidence of other

              However, most point mutations occur at low frequency, and the
              function of these alleles remains undefined. We have developed a
              scalable systematic approach to interrogate the function of
              cancer-associated gene variants. We subjected 474 mutant alleles
              curated from 5,338 tumors to pooled in vivo tumor formation assays
              and gene expression profiling. We identified 12 transforming
              alleles, including two in genes (PIK3CB, POT1) that have not been
              shown to be tumorigenic. One rare KRAS allele, D33E, displayed
              tumorigenicity and constitutive activation of known RAS effector
              pathways. By comparing gene expression changes induced upon
              expression of wild-type and mutant alleles, we inferred the
              activity of specific alleles. Because alleles found to be mutated
              only once in 5,338 tumors rendered cells tumorigenic, these
              observations underscore the value of integrating genomic
              information with functional studies. SIGNIFICANCE: Experimentally
              inferring the functional status of cancer-associated mutations
              facilitates the interpretation of genomic information in cancer.
              Pooled in vivo screen and gene expression profiling identified
              functional variants and demonstrated that expression of rare
              variants induced tumorigenesis. Variant phenotyping through

  abstract = "The problem of complex adaptations is studied in two largely
              disconnected research traditions: evolutionary biology and
              evolutionary computer science. This paper summarizes the results
              from both areas and compares their implications. In evolutionary
              computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of
              mutation, recombination and selection is not universally effective
              in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip
              designs. For adaptation to occur, these systems must possess
              ``evolvability,'' i.e., the ability of random variations to
              sometimes produce improvement. It was found that evolvability
              critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto
              phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation
              problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the variability of
              characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to
              be distinguished from variations, which are the actually realized
              differences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is the
              common theme underlying such varied biological phenomena as
              genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological
              versatility, developmental dissociability, and morphological
              integration. For evolutionary biology the representation problem
              has important implications: how is it that extant species acquired
              a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by mutation and
              selection? Is the genotype-phenotype map able to change in
              evolution? What are the selective forces, if any, that shape the
              genotype-phenotype map? We propose that the genotype-phenotype map
              can evolve by two main routes: epistatic mutations, or the
              creation of new genes. A common result for organismic design is
              modularity. By modularity we mean a genotype-phenotype map in
              which there are few pleiotropic effects among characters serving
              different functions, with pleiotropic effects falling mainly among
              characters that are part of a single functional complex. Such a
              design is expected to improve evolvability by limiting the
              interference between the adaptation of different functions.
              Several population genetic models are reviewed that are intended
              to explain the evolutionary origin of a modular design. While our
              current knowledge is insufficient to assess the plausibility of
              these models, they form the beginning of a framework for
              understanding the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map.",

               tumours. What do we know about tumour cell senescence in vivo,

               of cellular senescence, which is a stress response that stably

               Senescence is prevalent in pre-malignant tumours, and progression
               to malignancy requires evading senescence. Malignant tumours,
               however, may still undergo senescence owing to interventions that
               restore tumour suppressor function or inactivate oncogenes.
               Senescent tumour cells can be cleared by immune cells, which may
               result in efficient tumour regression. Standard chemotherapy also
               has the potential to induce senescence, which may partly underlie
               its therapeutic activity. Although these concepts are well

              significant metabolic rewiring, including the derepression of

              differences3-6 and immunoediting of neoantigens7,8; however, to
              our knowledge, no existing model weighs the relative contribution
              of these features to tumour evolution. We propose a unified
              theoretical 'free fitness' framework that parsimoniously
              integrates multimodal genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and
              proteomic data into a biophysical model of the rate-limiting
              processes underlying the fitness advantage conferred on cancer
              cells by driver gene mutations. Focusing on TP53, the most mutated
              gene in cancer1, we present an inference of mutant p53
              concentration and demonstrate that TP53 hotspot mutations
              optimally solve an evolutionary trade-off between oncogenic
              potential and neoantigen immunogenicity. Our model anticipates

              validated experimentally in patients with cancer and in a unique

              immune selective pressure on TP53 mutations has a smaller role in

              immunotherapy may offer an early prophylactic opportunity for the

              commonplace evolutionary hypothesis that adaptation, increased
              fitness within the selective environment, is accompanied by
              trade-off, a loss of fitness in other nonselective environments.
              Specifically, we determined whether trade-offs at high temperature
              generally and necessarily accompany genetic adaptation to low
              temperature. We measured the relative fitness increment of 24
              lineages of the bacterium Escherichia coli evolved for 2,000
              generations at 20 degrees C and the relative fitness decrement of
              these lines at 40 degrees C. Trade-offs at the higher temperature
              were examined for their generality, universality, quantitative
              relationship, and historical contingency. Considering all 24 lines
              as a group, a significant decline in fitness was found at 40
              degrees C (mean decline = 9.4\%), indicating the generality of the
              trade-off effect. However, in a lineage-by-lineage analysis, only
              15 of 24 showed a significant trade-off, and one lineage increased
              fitness at high temperature. Thus, although general, trade-offs
              were not universal. Furthermore, there was no quantitative
              association between the magnitude of adaptive fitness increment at
              20 degrees C and fitness decline at 40 degrees C, and no effect of
              lineages' historical thermal environment on either their
              improvement at 20 degrees C or the extent of their trade-off at
              high temperature. We do not yet know the underlying mechanisms
              responsible for the trade-off, but they are sufficiently prevalent
              to drive a general effect. However, approximately one-third of the
              experimental lineages achieved low-temperature adaptation without
              detectable high-temperature trade-offs; therefore, it cannot be
              necessary that every change conferring benefit in cold

              improvement in one or more traits is impeded by selection on

              populations evolving under more complex selection for growth rate

               trade-offs, such as those stemming from antagonistic pleiotropy,
               are thought to contribute to the maintenance of diversity in this
               scenario. Specifically, alleles that promote adaptation in one
               environment are expected to promote maladaptation in alternative
               environments. Contrary to this expectation, however, alleles that
               underlie locally adaptive traits often fail to exhibit fitness
               costs in alternative environments. Here, we attempt to explain
               this paradox by reviewing the results of experimental evolution
               studies, including a new one of our own, that examined the
               evolution of trade-offs during adaptation to homogeneous versus
               heterogeneous environments. We propose that when pleiotropic
               effects vary, whether or not trade-offs emerge among diverging
               populations will depend critically on ecology. For example,
               adaptation to a locally homogeneous environment is more likely to
               occur by alleles that are antagonistically pleiotropic than
               adaptation to a locally heterogeneous environment, simply because
               selection is blind to costs associated with environments that are
               not experienced locally. Our literature review confirmed the
               resulting prediction that performance trade-offs were more likely
               to evolve during selection in homogeneous than heterogeneous
               environments. The nature of the environmental heterogeneity

              allowed us to dissect out effects on gene expression that are
              specific to particular physiological states. Thus, we discovered
              that a large number of ORFs involved in protein synthesis were
              activated under ammonium limitation, whereas the expression of
              ORFs concerned with energy and metabolism was enhanced by carbon
              limitation. Elevated transcription of genes in high-affinity
              glucose uptake, the trichloroacetic acid cycle, and oxidative
              phosphorylation were observed in glucose-limiting, but not
              glucose-abundant, conditions. In contrast, genes involved in

              mutations related to specific stressors. Trade-offs evolved
              rapidly and dynamics of trade-off evolution varied between

              basis of resistance to each stressor. The degree of parallelism at
              the phenotypic level showed evidence of being modified by the

              predict the molecular basis of adaptive evolution. We studied the
              evolution of genetic networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding
              yeast) populations propagated for more than 200 generations in
              different nitrogen-limiting conditions. We find that rapid
              adaptive evolution in nitrogen-poor environments is dominated by
              the de novo generation and selection of copy number variants
              (CNVs), a large fraction of which contain genes encoding specific
              nitrogen transporters including PUT4, DUR3 and DAL4. The large
              fitness increases associated with these alleles limits the genetic
              heterogeneity of adapting populations even in environments with
              multiple nitrogen sources. Complete identification of acquired
              point mutations, in individual lineages and entire populations,
              identified heterogeneity at the level of genetic loci but common
              themes at the level of functional modules, including genes
              controlling phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate metabolism and
              vacuole biogenesis. Adaptive strategies shared with other
              nutrient-limited environments point to selection of genetic
              variation in the TORC1 and Ras/PKA signaling pathways as a general
              mechanism underlying improved growth in nutrient-limited
              environments. Within a single population we observed the repeated
              independent selection of a multi-locus genotype, comprised of the
              functionally related genes GAT1, MEP2 and LST4. By studying the

              the order in which these mutations are acquired is constrained by
              epistasis. The identification of repeatedly selected variation at
              functionally related loci that interact epistatically suggests
              that gene network polymorphisms (GNPs) may be a frequent outcome

              mechanistic basis by which cells adapt to nutrient-limited

              independently evolved in the same biosynthetic pathway following
              exposure to the fungicide nystatin. We found that genetic
              interactions are prevalent and predominantly negative, with the
              majority of mutations causing lower growth when combined in a
              double mutant than when alone as a single mutant (sign epistasis).
              The prevalence of sign epistasis is surprising given the small
              number of mutations tested and runs counter to expectations for
              mutations arising in a single biosynthetic pathway in the face of
              a simple selective pressure. Furthermore, in one third of pairwise

              large-effect beneficial mutations that may become maladaptive in
              other environments. Conversely, natural settings require
              populations to endure environmental fluctuations. A sensible
              assumption is that the fitness of a lineage in a fluctuating
              environment is the time-average of its fitness over the sequence
              of static conditions it encounters. However, transitions between
              conditions may pose entirely new challenges, which could cause
              deviations from this time-average. To test this, we tracked
              hundreds of thousands of barcoded yeast lineages evolving in
              static and fluctuating conditions and subsequently isolated 900
              mutants for pooled fitness assays in 15 environments. We find that
              fitness in fluctuating environments indeed often deviates from the
              expectation based on static components, leading to fitness
              non-additivity. Moreover, closer examination reveals that fitness
              in one component of a fluctuating environment is often strongly
              influenced by the previous component. We show that this
              environmental memory is especially common for mutants with high

              components of the focal fluctuating environment are excluded from

              However, the diversity of adaptive mutations is not well

              generations in a well-studied laboratory evolution experiment in
              Escherichia coli. The extensive duration of this experiment

              that its expression is dramatically increased in cells with
              dysfunctional mitochondria, such as in rho(o) petites. Three genes

              heterodimer to the CIT2 upstream activation site, and RTG2, which

              the dual control of specific induction and nitrogen source
              regulation. We have here identified UASaro, a 36-bp upstream
              element necessary and sufficient to promote transcriptional
              induction of reporter gene expression in response to tryptophan,
              phenylalanine, or tyrosine. We then isolated mutants in which
              UASaro-mediated ARO9 transcription is partially or totally
              impaired. Mutations abolishing ARO9 induction affect a gene called
              ARO80 (YDR421w), coding for a Zn2Cys6 family transcription factor.
              A sequence highly similar to UASaro was found upstream from the
              YDR380w gene encoding a homolog of bacterial indolepyruvate
              decarboxylase. In yeast, this enzyme is postulated to catalyze the

              disrupted allele (kgd1::URA3) induced a deficiency in
              alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The sequence of the cloned
              region of DNA which complements kgd1 mutants was found to have an
              open reading frame of 3,042 nucleotides capable of coding for a
              protein of Mw 114,470. The encoded protein had 38\% identical
              residues with the reported sequence of alpha-ketoglutarate
              dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli. Two lines of evidence
              indicated that transcription of KGD1 is catabolite repressed.
              Higher steady-state levels of KGD1 mRNA were detected in wild-type
              yeast grown on the nonrepressible sugar galactose than in yeast
              grown on high glucose. Regulation of KGD1 was also studied by
              fusing different 5'-flanking regions of KGD1 to the lacZ gene of
              E. coli and measuring the expression of beta-galactosidase in
              yeast. Transformants harboring a fusion of 693 nucleotides of the
              5'-flanking sequence expressed 10 times more beta-galactosidase
              activity when grown under derepressed conditions. The response to
              the carbon source was reduced dramatically when the same lacZ
              fusion was present in a hap2 or hap3 mutant. The promoter
              element(s) responsible for the regulated expression of KGD1 has

              Recent studies indicated that the number of mitochondrial
              phosphoproteins is higher than expected; however, the effect of
              reversible phosphorylation on mitochondrial structure and function
              has only been defined in a few cases. It is thus crucial to
              determine authentic protein phosphorylation sites from highly
              purified mitochondria in a genetically tractable organism. The
              yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a major model organism for the
              analysis of mitochondrial functions. We isolated highly pure yeast
              mitochondria and performed a systematic analysis of
              phosphorylation sites by a combination of different enrichment
              strategies and mass spectrometry. We identified 80 phosphorylation
              sites in 48 different proteins. These mitochondrial
              phosphoproteins are involved in critical mitochondrial functions,
              including energy metabolism, protein biogenesis, fatty acid
              metabolism, metabolite transport, and redox regulation. By
              combining yeast genetics and in vitro biochemical analysis, we
              found that phosphorylation of a serine residue in subunit g
              (Atp20) regulates dimerization of the mitochondrial ATP synthase.
              The authentic phosphoproteome of yeast mitochondria will represent
              a rich source to uncover novel roles of reversible protein

               ITH by single-cell RNA sequencing, but each study typically
               profiled only a small number of tumours and provided a narrow
               view of transcriptional ITH2. Here we curate, annotate and
               integrate the data from 77 different studies to reveal the
               patterns of transcriptional ITH across 1,163 tumour samples
               covering 24 tumour types. Among the malignant cells, we identify
               41 consensus meta-programs, each consisting of dozens of genes
               that are coordinately upregulated in subpopulations of cells
               within many tumours. The meta-programs cover diverse cellular
               processes including both generic (for example, cell cycle and
               stress) and lineage-specific patterns that we map into 11
               hallmarks of transcriptional ITH. Most meta-programs of carcinoma
               cells are similar to those identified in non-malignant epithelial

               are variable even before oncogenesis, reflecting the biology of
               their cell of origin. We further extended the meta-program

              deaths per year in the United States. Compared to other cancer

               long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of somatic mutation
               rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here we performed
               whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56
               individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16
               mammalian species. We found that somatic mutagenesis was
               dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all
               species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative
               damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other

               affecting multiple distinct phenotypic traits and has broad
               implications in many areas of biology. Due to its central
               importance, pleiotropy has also been extensively modeled, albeit
               with virtually no empirical basis. Analyzing phenotypes of large
               numbers of yeast, nematode, and mouse mutants, we here describe
               the genomic patterns of pleiotropy. We show that the fraction of
               traits altered appreciably by the deletion of a gene is minute
               for most genes and the gene-trait relationship is highly modular.
               The standardized size of the phenotypic effect of a gene on a
               trait is approximately normally distributed with variable SDs for
               different genes, which gives rise to the surprising observation
               of a larger per-trait effect for genes affecting more traits.
               This scaling property counteracts the pleiotropy-associated
               reduction in adaptation rate (i.e., the ``cost of complexity'')
               in a nonlinear fashion, resulting in the highest adaptation rate
               for organisms of intermediate complexity rather than low
               complexity. Intriguingly, the observed scaling exponent falls in
               a narrow range that maximizes the optimal complexity. Together,
               the genome-wide observations of overall low pleiotropy, high
               modularity, and larger per-trait effects from genes of higher
               pleiotropy necessitate major revisions of theoretical models of
               pleiotropy and suggest that pleiotropy has not only allowed but
               also promoted the evolution of complexity.",

               liability inherent to multicellular life forms in which an
               individual cell is capable of reneging on the interests of the
               collective organism. Although cancer is commonly described as an
               evolutionary process, a less appreciated aspect of tumorigenesis
               may be the constraints imposed by the organism's developmental
               programs. Recent work from single-cell transcriptomic analyses
               across a range of cancer types has revealed the recurrence,
               plasticity, and co-option of distinct cellular states among
               cancer cell populations. Here, we note that across diverse cancer
               types, the observed cell states are proximate within the
               developmental hierarchy of the cell of origin. We thus posit a
               model by which cancer cell states are directly constrained by the
               organism's ``developmental map.'' According to this model, a
               population of cancer cells traverses the developmental map,
               thereby generating a heterogeneous set of states whose
               interactions underpin emergent tumor behavior.",

              Here we mapped mutant clones in skin from high- and low-risk
              sites. The density of mutations varied by location. The prevalence
              of NOTCH1 and FAT1 mutations in forearm, trunk, and leg skin was

              Eleven mutant genes were under positive selection, with TP53

              normal human pancreas with a machine-learning pipeline for
              quantitative 3D histological reconstruction at single-cell
              resolution. To elucidate genetic relationships between and within

              assigned to one of three classes. The holoclone has the greatest
              reproductive capacity: under standard conditions, fewer than 5\%
              of the colonies formed by the cells of a holoclone abort and
              terminally differentiate. The paraclone contains exclusively cells
              with a short replicative lifespan (not more than 15 cell
              generations), after which they uniformly abort and terminally
              differentiate. The third type of clone, the meroclone, contains a
              mixture of cells of different growth potential and is a
              transitional stage between the holoclone and the paraclone. The
              incidence of the different clonal types is affected by aging,
              since cells originating from the epidermis of older donors give
              rise to a lower proportion of holoclones and a higher proportion
              of paraclones.",

              presence of fibroblasts, but proiiferation of fibroblasts must be
              controlled so that the epidermal cell population is not overgrown.
              Both conditions can be achieved by the use of lethally irradiated
              3T3 cells at the correct denairy. When trypsinized human skin
              cells are plated together with the 3T3 cells, the growth of the
              human fibroblasts is largety suppressed, but the epidermal cels
              grow from singte ceils into cotonies. Each colony consists of
              keratinocytes ultimerely forming a stratified squamous epithelium
              in which the dividing cells are confined to the lowest layer(s).
              Hydrocortisone is added to the medium, since in secondary and
              subsequent subcultures it makes the coiony morphology more orderly
              and distinctive, and maintains proliferation at a slightly greater
              rate. Under these culture conditions, it is possible to isotate
              keratinocyte clones free of viable fibroblasts. Like human diploid
              fibroblasts, human diploid keratinocytes appear fo have a finite
              caiture lifetime. For 7 strains studied, the culture lifetime
              ranged from 20–50 cell generations. The plating efficiency of the
              epidermal cells taken directly from skin was usually 0.1–1.0\%. On

                 sixty, but little is known about how age impacts tumorigenesis.
                 While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation — widely
                 understood to contribute to cancer risk — it is also associated
                 with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to
                 impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in
                 the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age
                 may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses
                 tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse
                 models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact
                 of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with
                 the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the
                 PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent.
                 Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic
                 cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related
                 transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact
                 that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore,
                 the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly
                 age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of
                 aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our
                 findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung
                 cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing
                 effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive
                 effects of aging.",

               chromatin accessibility patterns, as they disrupt differentiation
               topologies leading to abnormal clonal outgrowth. However,
               defining the impact of somatic mutations on the epigenome in
               human samples is challenging due to admixed mutated and wild-type
               cells. Here, to chart how somatic mutations disrupt epigenetic
               landscapes in human clonal outgrowths, we developed genotyping of
               targeted loci with single-cell chromatin accessibility (GoT–ChA).
               This high-throughput platform links genotypes to chromatin
               accessibility at single-cell resolution across thousands of cells
               within a single assay. We applied GoT–ChA to CD34+ cells from
               patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms with JAK2V617F-mutated
               haematopoiesis. Differential accessibility analysis between
               wild-type and JAK2V617F-mutant progenitors revealed both
               cell-intrinsic and cell-state-specific shifts within mutant
               haematopoietic precursors, including cell-intrinsic
               pro-inflammatory signatures in haematopoietic stem cells, and a
               distinct profibrotic inflammatory chromatin landscape in
               megakaryocytic progenitors. Integration of mitochondrial genome
               profiling and cell-surface protein expression measurement allowed
               expansion of genotyping onto DOGMA-seq through imputation,
               enabling single-cell capture of genotypes, chromatin
               accessibility, RNA expression and cell-surface protein
               expression. Collectively, we show that the JAK2V617F mutation
               leads to epigenetic rewiring in a cell-intrinsic and cell
               type-specific manner, influencing inflammation states and
               differentiation trajectories. We envision that GoT–ChA will
               empower broad future investigations of the critical link between
               somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations across clonal
               populations in malignant and non-malignant contexts. The

               processes of interest occur in optically opaque or physically
               inaccessible contexts, necessitating approaches other than direct
               imaging. Here we describe a synthetic system that enables cells
               to record lineage information and event histories in the genome
               in a format that can be subsequently read out of single cells in
               situ. This system, termed memory by engineered mutagenesis with
               optical in situ readout (MEMOIR), is based on a set of barcoded
               recording elements termed scratchpads. The state of a given
               scratchpad can be irreversibly altered by CRISPR/Cas9-based
               targeted mutagenesis, and later read out in single cells through
               multiplexed single-molecule RNA fluorescence hybridization
               (smFISH). Using MEMOIR as a proof of principle, we engineered
               mouse embryonic stem cells to contain multiple scratchpads and
               other recording components. In these cells, scratchpads were
               altered in a progressive and stochastic fashion as the cells
               proliferated. Analysis of the final states of scratchpads in
               single cells in situ enabled reconstruction of lineage
               information from cell colonies. Combining analysis of endogenous
               gene expression with lineage reconstruction in the same cells
               further allowed inference of the dynamic rates at which embryonic
               stem cells switch between two gene expression states. Finally,
               using simulations, we show how parallel MEMOIR systems operating
               in the same cell could enable recording and readout of dynamic
               cellular event histories. MEMOIR thus provides a versatile
               platform for information recording and in situ, single-cell

              conditions, including tumor suppression [2], embryonic development
              [3, 4], tissue repair [5-8], and organismal aging [9]. The
              senescence program is variably characterized by several

              (DDR) signaling, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-βgal)

              solvent-exposed protein regions. They are also typically younger,
              occur at lower frequencies, and more often found in heterozygous
              states, suggesting they are subject to purifying selection. A
              substantial fraction of non-neutral variants showing strong
              fitness effects in our experiments, however, is present at high
              frequencies in the population. These variants show signs of local

              strains adapted to human-made environments. Our findings support
              the view that while common variants are often neutral, a
              significant proportion have adaptive functional consequences and
              are driven into the population by local positive selection. This

               mutations begin as nucleotide mismatches or damage in one of the
               two strands of the DNA before becoming double-strand mutations if
               unrepaired or misrepaired3,4. However, current DNA-sequencing
               technologies cannot accurately resolve these initial
               single-strand events. Here we develop a single-molecule,
               long-read sequencing method (Hairpin Duplex Enhanced Fidelity
               sequencing (HiDEF-seq)) that achieves single-molecule fidelity
               for base substitutions when present in either one or both DNA
               strands. HiDEF-seq also detects cytosine deamination—a common
               type of DNA damage—with single-molecule fidelity. We profiled 134
               samples from diverse tissues, including from individuals with
               cancer predisposition syndromes, and derive from them
               single-strand mismatch and damage signatures. We find
               correspondences between these single-strand signatures and known
               double-strand mutational signatures, which resolves the identity
               of the initiating lesions. Tumours deficient in both mismatch
               repair and replicative polymerase proofreading show distinct
               single-strand mismatch patterns compared to samples that are
               deficient in only polymerase proofreading. We also define a
               single-strand damage signature for APOBEC3A. In the mitochondrial
               genome, our findings support a mutagenic mechanism occurring
               primarily during replication. As double-strand DNA mutations are
               only the end point of the mutation process, our approach to
               detect the initiating single-strand events at single-molecule
               resolution will enable studies of how mutations arise in a
               variety of contexts, especially in cancer and ageing. A DNA
               sequencing method with single-molecule fidelity detects
               mismatches and damage present in only one of the two DNA strands
               with patterns that are both similar and distinct compared to
               known mutation patterns.",

              multiple resistant cell fates emerge in melanoma following
              treatment with targeted therapy and that, in vitro, these
              resistant fates are determined by the transcriptional state of
              individual cells prior to exposure to treatment. What remains
              unclear is whether these resistant fates are shared across
              different genetic backgrounds and how, if at all, these resistant

              distinct resistance programs in melanoma cells shaped by both

              Consensus non-negative matrix factorization revealed shared

               tumour-free mice when allowed to develop within the confines of
               healthy embryos. Conversely, recent evidence suggests that adult

               prominently visible in the form of non-clonal chromosomal
               aberrations, suggests that Darwinian selection of mutant cells is
               not operating at maximal efficacy. Conversely, non-genetic
               instability of cancer cells must also be considered. Such
               mutation-independent instability of cell states is most
               prosaically manifest in the phenotypic heterogeneity within
               clonal cell populations or in the reversible switching between
               immature ``cancer stem cell-like'' and more differentiated
               states. How are genetic and non-genetic instability related to
               each other? Here, we review basic theoretical foundations and
               offer a dynamical systems perspective in which cancer is the
               inevitable pathological manifestation of modes of malfunction
               that are immanent to the complex gene regulatory network of the
               genome. We explain in an accessible, qualitative, and
               permissively simplified manner the mathematical basis for the
               ``epigenetic landscape'' and how the latter relates to the better
               known ``fitness landscape.'' We show that these two classical
               metaphors have a formal basis. By combining these two landscape
               concepts, we unite development and somatic evolution as the
               drivers of the relentless increase in malignancy. Herein, the
               cancer cells are pushed toward cancer attractors in the
               evolutionarily unused regions of the epigenetic landscape that
               encode more and more ``dedifferentiated'' states as a consequence
               of both genetic (mutagenic) and non-genetic (regulatory)
               perturbations-including therapy. This would explain why for the
               cancer cell, the principle of ``What does not kill me makes me
               stronger'' is as much a driving force in tumor progression and
               development of drug resistance as the simple principle of
               ``survival of the fittest.''",

                 drive clonal expansions, a phenomenon called clonal

                 haematological cancer, cardiovascular disease and lower life
                 expectancy and is strongly age-dependent, becoming almost
                 ubiquitous in older adults. However, the dynamics of CH are not
                 yet fully understood, and an accurate quantitative model of
                 clonal expansion in healthy people could inform early detection
                 strategies. Here, we analyse the age-dependence of the variant
                 allele frequency (VAF) distributions of common CH driver
                 variants from the exomes of 400,000 cancer-free UK Biobank
                 participants. We find evidence of a substantial deceleration of
                 clonal expansion with age taking place in younger people. This
                 deceleration appears to be general: different CH hotspot
                 variants all displayed a ∼ 3-fold reduction in growth rate
                 between young and old. We develop several alternative models of
                 clonal dynamics that might explain this age-related
                 deceleration. First we show that variation in fitness of
                 variants among individuals (e.g., due to genetic
                 susceptibility) is unable to produce the required deceleration.
                 Second, we consider a clonal competition model in which clonal
                 expansion in later life is inhibited by competition with an
                 unobserved background of other expanding clones. Finally, we
                 consider an ageing model where HSC division slows down with
                 increasing age. The observed age-specific VAF distributions are
                 consistent with the ageing model with plausible parameters. To
                 further interrogate these models, we consider a large data set
                 of longitudinal growth rates obtained from serial samples of
                 blood. These data suggest that a general slowdown of HSC
                 division rates plays a key role in shaping the genetic
                 diversity of ageing blood.",

               functional consequences remain understudied. Here we use genomic
               analyses of 106 human cell lines grown in two laboratories to
               show extensive clonal diversity. Further comprehensive genomic
               characterization of 27 strains of the common breast cancer cell

               results were obtained with multiple strains of 13 additional cell

               improving a small number of traits. However, adaptive mutations
               identified early in microbial evolution experiments, cancer, and
               other systems often provide substantial fitness gains and

               such pleiotropically adaptive mutations are common throughout
               adaptation or are instead a rare feature of early steps in
               evolution that tend to target key signaling pathways. To do so,
               we conducted barcoded second-step evolution experiments initiated
               from 5 first-step mutations identified from a prior yeast
               evolution experiment. We then isolated hundreds of second-step
               mutations from these evolution experiments, measured their
               fitness and performance in several growth phases, and conducted
               whole genome sequencing of the second-step clones. Here, we found

               towards modular adaptation, mostly improving respiration
               performance and only rarely improving fermentation performance.
               We also identified a shift in the molecular basis of adaptation
               from genes in cellular signaling pathways towards genes involved
               in respiration and mitochondrial function. Our results suggest
               that the genes in cellular signaling pathways may be more likely
               to provide large, adaptively pleiotropic benefits to the organism
               due to their ability to coherently affect many phenotypes at
               once. As such, these genes may serve as the source of pleiotropic
               adaptation in the early stages of evolution, and once these
               become exhausted, organisms then adapt more gradually, acquiring
               smaller, more modular mutations.",

                 maintain sex throughout nature despite its substantial direct
                 costs is a longstanding challenge in biology. Previous work has
                 shown that sexual recombination provides a key advantage in
                 speeding adaptation, in part by separating beneficial mutations
                 from deleterious hitchhikers. However, these earlier studies
                 have focused on the effects of sex in a constant environment.
                 Here, we show that recombination also provides a key advantage
                 in fluctuating conditions, promoting the evolution of
                 generalist phenotypes by reducing the pleiotropic costs of
                 local adaptation. Using laboratory evolution in S. cerevisiae
                 as a model system, we show that hitchhiking genetic load leads
                 to pleiotropic costs and hence specialization in response to

               Here we present 'CellTagging', a combinatorial cell-indexing
               methodology that enables parallel capture of clonal history and
               cell identity, in which sequential rounds of cell labelling
               enable the construction of multi-level lineage trees. CellTagging
               and longitudinal tracking of fibroblast to induced endoderm
               progenitor reprogramming reveals two distinct trajectories: one
               leading to successfully reprogrammed cells, and one leading to a
               'dead-end' state, paths determined in the earliest stages of
               lineage conversion. We find that expression of a putative

               reprogramming trajectory; adding Mettl7a1 to the reprogramming

               Using competing match and mismatch probes, Zombie can accurately

               cancer, we elucidate the developmental trajectories of normal and

               single nucleotide variants per year, predominantly attributable
               to endogenous mutational processes. In individuals with gastric
               cancer, glands often show elevated mutation burdens due to
               acceleration of mutational processes linked to proliferation and
               oxidative damage. These hypermutant glands were primarily
               detected in the gastric antrum and were mostly associated with

               increasingly used to infer copy number information from

               captured off-target reads to infer copy number evenly across the

               and intergenic regions to identify copy number changes. In
               particular, we successfully inferred copy number at equivalent to
               100-kilobase resolution genome-wide from a platform targeting as

               leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. Tradeoffs are common in
               evolution and occur when, for example, resistance to one drug
               results in sensitivity to another. Major questions remain about
               the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically, whether
               the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer
               similar tradeoffs. This question is difficult because the
               drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic, and even those
               evolved in controlled laboratory settings, are often biased
               towards those that provide large fitness benefits. Thus, the
               mutations (and mechanisms) that provide drug resistance may be
               more diverse than current data suggests. Here, we perform
               evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a
               fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness
               advantage in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. We then
               quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across
               12 environments, finding these mutants group into 6 classes with
               characteristically different tradeoffs. Their unique tradeoffs
               may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through
               different underlying mechanisms. Some of the groupings we find
               are surprising. For example, we find some mutants that resist
               single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do.
               And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than
               others. These findings, on one hand, demonstrate the difficulty
               in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing
               multidrug treatments. On the other hand, by demonstrating that
               hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups
               with characteristic tradeoffs, our findings may yet empower
               multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat
               resistance. More generally speaking, by grouping mutants that
               likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, our
               work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation.",

               second most common human cancer and have been characterized by
               RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq); however, the transferability of
               findings from individual studies may be limited by small sample
               sizes and diverse analysis protocols. OBJECTIVES: To define the
               transcriptome landscape at different stages in the progression of
               normal skin to cSCC via a meta-analysis of publicly available
               RNA-Seq samples. METHODS: Whole-transcriptome data from 73
               clinically normal skin samples, 46 actinic keratoses (AK)
               samples, 16 in situ SCC samples, 13 keratoacanthoma (KA) samples
               and 147 cSCC samples [including 30 samples from immunocompromised
               patients and 8 from individuals with recessive dystrophic
               epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB)] were uniformly processed to
               harmonize gene expression. Differential expression, fusion
               detection and cell-type deconvolution analyses were performed.
               RESULTS: Individual RNA-Seq studies of cSCC demonstrated
               study-specific clustering and varied widely in their differential
               gene expression detection. Following batch correction, we defined
               a consensus set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs),
               including those altered in the preinvasive stages of cSCC
               development, and used single-cell RNA-Seq data to demonstrate
               that DEGs are often - but not always - expressed by
               tumour-specific keratinocytes (TSKs). Analysis of the cellular
               composition of cSCC, KA and RDEB-cSCC identified an increase in
               differentiated keratinocytes in KA, while RDEB-cSCC contained the
               most TSKs. Compared with cSCC arising in immunocompetent
               individuals, cSCC samples from immunosuppressed patients
               demonstrated fewer memory B cells and CD8+ T cells. A
               comprehensive and unbiased search for fusion transcripts in cSCC
               and intermediate disease stages identified few candidates that
               recurred in >1\% of all specimens, suggesting that most cSCC are
               not driven by oncogenic gene fusions. Finally, using
               Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data, we distilled a novel
               300-gene signature of chronic sun exposure that affirms greater
               cumulative ultraviolet (UV) exposure in later stages of cSCC
               development. CONCLUSIONS: Our results define the gene expression
               landscape of cSCC progression, characterize cell subpopulation
               heterogeneity in cSCC subtypes that contribute to their distinct
               clinical phenotypes, demonstrate that gene fusions are not a
               common cause of cSCC and identify UV-responsive genes associated
               with cSCC development.",

               in the tumor microenvironment. Crosstalk between tumor cells and
               CAFs contributes to tumor survival in most epithelial cancers.
               Recently, utilizing gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) as a
               model for sarcomas, we identified paracrine networks by which
               CAFs promote tumor progression and metastasis. However, the
               mechanisms by which CAFs arise in sarcomas remain unclear. Here,
               RNA sequencing analysis revealed that transforming growth
               factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is highly expressed in both tumor cells and
               CAFs. To determine the functional role of TGF-β1, we treated
               normal gastric fibroblasts (GFs) with recombinant TGF-β1, which
               caused the GFs to adopt a more stellate morphology, as well as
               increased the mRNA expression of CAF-mediated genes (CCL2, RAB3B,
               and TNC) and genes encoding fibroblast growth factors (FGFs).
               Moreover, while either GIST or CAF conditioned media enhanced the
               transition from GFs to CAFs, a TGF-β1-blocking antibody
               attenuated this effect. Transwell migration assays revealed that
               the TGF-β1-mediated transition from GFs to CAFs enhanced tumor
               cell migration. This migratory effect was abrogated by an
               anti-TGF-β1 antibody, suggesting that TGF-β1 secreted from GIST
               cells or CAFs is associated with GIST migration via GF-to-CAF
               transition. In addition, the murine spleen-to-liver metastasis
               model showed that GF pre-treated with TGF-β1 promoted GIST
               metastasis. Collectively, these findings reveal unappreciated
               crosstalk among tumor cells, CAFs, and normal resident
               fibroblasts in the stroma of sarcomas, which enhances a GF-to-CAF

               transition (EMT), TGF-β1 signaling and the Zinc finger
               transcriptional repressor protein Slug, in vimentin-deficient
               (VIM(-/-)) wounds. Correspondingly, VIM(-/-) wounds exhibited
               loss of EMT-like keratinocyte activation, limited keratinization,
               and slow reepithelialization. Furthermore, the fibroblast
               deficiency abolished collagen accumulation in the VIM(-/-)
               wounds. Vimentin reconstitution in VIM(-/-) fibroblasts restored
               both their proliferation and TGF-β1 production. Similarly,
               restoring paracrine TGF-β-Slug-EMT signaling reactivated the
               transdifferentiation of keratinocytes, reviving their migratory
               properties, a critical feature for efficient healing. Our results

               fibroblast proliferation, TGF-β1-Slug signaling, collagen

               driving factors of tumor progression and invasion. Inside this
               microenvironment, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a type of
               perpetually activated fibroblasts, have been implicated to have a
               strong tumor-modulating effect and play a key role in areas such
               as drug resistance. Identification of CAFs has typically been
               carried based on the expression of various ``CAF markers'', such
               as fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) and alpha smooth
               muscle actin (αSMA), which separates them from the larger pool of
               fibroblasts present in the body. However, as outlined in this
               Review, the expression of various commonly used fibroblast
               markers is extremely heterogeneous and varies strongly between
