  abstract  = "Senescence refers to a cellular state featuring a stable
               cell‐cycle arrest triggered in response to stress. This response
               also involves other distinct morphological and intracellular
               changes including alterations in gene expression and epigenetic
               modifications, elevated macromolecular damage, metabolism
               deregulation and a complex pro‐inflammatory secretory phenotype.
               The initial demonstration of oncogene‐induced senescence in
               vitro established senescence as an important tumour‐suppressive
               mechanism, in addition to apoptosis. Senescence not only halts
               the proliferation of premalignant cells but also facilitates the
               clearance of affected cells through immunosurveillance. Failure
               to clear senescent cells owing to deficient immunosurveillance
               may, however, lead to a state of chronic inflammation that
               nurtures a pro‐tumorigenic microenvironment favouring cancer
               initiation, migration and metastasis. In addition, senescence is
               a response to post‐therapy genotoxic stress. Therefore, tracking
               the emergence of senescent cells becomes pivotal to detect
               potential pro‐tumorigenic events. Current protocols for the in
               vivo detection of senescence require the analysis of fixed or
               deep‐frozen tissues, despite a significant clinical need for
               real‐time bioimaging methods. Accuracy and efficiency of
               senescence detection are further hampered by a lack of universal
               and more specific senescence biomarkers. Recently, in an attempt
               to overcome these hurdles, an assortment of detection tools has
               been developed. These strategies all have significant potential
               for clinical utilisation and include flow cytometry combined
               with histo‐ or cytochemical approaches, nanoparticle‐based
               targeted delivery of imaging contrast agents, OFF‐ON fluorescent
               senoprobes, positron emission tomography senoprobes and analysis
               of circulating SASP factors, extracellular vesicles and
               cell‐free nucleic acids isolated from plasma. Here, we highlight
               the occurrence of senescence in neoplasia and advanced tumours,
               assess the impact of senescence on tumorigenesis and discuss how

              contributing to growth advantage in multiple stress environments.
              MKT1 has been shown to regulate HO endonuclease
              posttranscriptionally via the Pbp1-Pab1 complex. RNA-binding
              protein Puf3 modulates a set of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
              transcripts whose expression was found to be affected by MKT1
              alleles. This study attempts to relate the MKT1 allele-derived
              growth advantage with the stability of Puf3 targets during stress
              and elucidate the roles of Pbp1 and Puf3 in this mechanism. Our
              results showed that the growth advantage of the MKT189G allele in
              cycloheximide and H2 O2 was PBP1-dependent, whereas in
              4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, the growth advantage was dependent on
              both PUF3 and PBP1. We compared the messenger RNA decay kinetics
              of a set of Puf3 targets in multiple stress environments to
              understand the allele-specific regulation by MKT1. In oxidative
              stress, the MKT189G allele modulated the differential expression
              of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in a PBP1- and
              PUF3-dependent manner. Additionally, MKT189G stabilised Puf3

              stress-specific manner. Our results showed that COX17, MRS1 and

              the MKT189G allele contributing to better growth; this response
              was both PBP1- and PUF3-dependent. Our results indicate that the
              common allele, MKT189G , regulates stress responses by
              differentially stabilising Puf3-target mitochondrial genes, which
              allows for the strain's better growth in stress environments.",

              brain to initiate gliomagenesis and enable direct tracing of
              glioblastoma evolution from its earliest possible stage.
              Unexpectedly, we observe a high incidence of clonal extinction
              events and progressive divergence in clonal sizes, even after the
              acquisition of malignant phenotype. Computational modeling
              suggests these dynamics result from clonal-based cell-cell
              competition. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptome analyses,
              coupled with lineage tracing, we reveal that Myc transcriptional
              targets have the strongest correlation with clonal size
              imbalances. Moreover, we show that the downregulation of Myc
              expression is sufficient to drive competitive dynamics in
              intracranially transplanted gliomas. Our findings provide
              insights into glioblastoma evolution that are inaccessible using
              conventional retrospective approaches, highlighting the potential

              acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The
              hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing
              the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining
              proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting
              cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing
              angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying
              these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the
              genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and
              inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions.
              Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging
              hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of
              energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to
              cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity:
              they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells
              that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating
              the ``tumor microenvironment.'' Recognition of the widespread
              applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the
              development of new means to treat human cancer.",

              CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) across >2.5 million human cells. We

              biogenesis (including CCDC86, ZNF236, and SPATA5L1),
              transcription (C7orf26), and mitochondrial respiration (TMEM242).
              In addition to assigning gene function, single-cell
              transcriptional phenotypes allow for in-depth dissection of
              complex cellular phenomena-from RNA processing to
              differentiation. We leverage this ability to systematically
              identify genetic drivers and consequences of aneuploidy and to
              discover an unanticipated layer of stress-specific regulation of
              the mitochondrial genome. Our information-rich genotype-phenotype

              switch from protease-independent to an MT1-MMP-dependent mode of
              invasion. We did not observe changes in expression of the
              melanoma phenotype determinant MITF during cooperative invasion,

              melanoma progression without the need for clonal selection or
              phenotype switching and can account for the preservation of
              heterogeneity seen throughout tumor progression.",

              fate of its bound transcripts that encode proteins required for
              mitochondrial biogenesis. Upon glucose depletion, Puf3p becomes
              heavily phosphorylated within its N-terminal region of low

              of its target mRNAs. Such nutrient-responsive phosphorylation
              toggles the activity of Puf3p to promote either degradation or
              translation of these mRNAs according to the needs of the cell.
              Moreover, activation of translation of pre-existing mRNAs might
              enable rapid adjustment to environmental changes without the need

              specific growth conditions, it is challenging to determine where
              within a growth-saturation cycle those fitness gains occur. A
              common implicit assumption is that most benefits derive from an

              batch serial transfer experiments, adaptive mutants' fitness
              gains can be dominated by benefits that are accrued in one growth
              cycle, but not realized until the next growth cycle. For
              thousands of evolved clones (most with only a single mutation),

              respiration, and stationary phases to assess how their fitness,

              with experimental and clinical data",
  author   = "Lee, Nathan D and Kaveh, Kamran and Bozic, Ivana",
  abstract = "Tumors consist of different genotypically distinct
              subpopulations-or subclones-of cells. These subclones can
              influence neighboring clones in a process called ``clonal
              interaction.'' Conventionally, research on driver mutations in
              cancer has focused on their cell-autonomous effects that lead to
              an increase in fitness of the cells containing the driver.
              Recently, with the advent of improved experimental and
              computational technologies for investigating tumor heterogeneity
              and clonal dynamics, new studies have shown the importance of
              clonal interactions in cancer initiation, progression, and
              metastasis. In this review we provide an overview of clonal
              interactions in cancer, discussing key discoveries from a diverse
              range of approaches to cancer biology research. We discuss common
              types of clonal interactions, such as cooperation and
              competition, its mechanisms, and the overall effect on
              tumorigenesis, with important implications for tumor
              heterogeneity, resistance to treatment, and tumor suppression.
              Quantitative models-in coordination with cell culture and animal
              model experiments-have played a vital role in investigating the
              nature of clonal interactions and the complex clonal dynamics
              they generate. We present mathematical and computational models
              that can be used to represent clonal interactions and provide
              examples of the roles they have played in identifying and
              quantifying the strength of clonal interactions in experimental
              systems. Clonal interactions have proved difficult to observe in
              clinical data; however, several very recent quantitative
              approaches enable their detection. We conclude by discussing ways
              in which researchers can further integrate quantitative methods
              with experimental and clinical data to elucidate the critical-and
              often surprising-roles of clonal interactions in human cancers.",

              classic genetic explanation is antagonistic pleiotropy: genes

              However, the mechanisms that promote OIS escape remain unclear,

              Here, we unravel the regulatory mechanisms underlying OIS escape

              The inhibitory form of Mks1p is phosphorylated and complexed with

              regulators of RS. A hypophosphorylated form of Mks1p bound to
              Rtg2p is inactive. Point mutations in the Rtg2p ATP binding

              with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to
              chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Whether the dismal prognosis

               difficult to know what happened in the deep past and to
               characterize other paths that evolution could have followed.
               Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction, directed
               evolution and biophysical analysis to explore alternative
               'might-have-been' trajectories during the ancient evolution of a
               novel protein function. We previously found that the evolution
               of cortisol specificity in the ancestral glucocorticoid receptor
               (GR) was contingent on permissive substitutions, which had no
               apparent effect on receptor function but were necessary for GR
               to tolerate the large-effect mutations that caused the shift in
               specificity. Here we show that alternative mutations that could
               have permitted the historical function-switching substitutions
               are extremely rare in the ensemble of genotypes accessible to
               the ancestral GR. In a library of thousands of variants of the
               ancestral protein, we recovered historical permissive
               substitutions but no alternative permissive genotypes. Using
               biophysical analysis, we found that permissive mutations must
               satisfy at least three physical requirements--they must
               stabilize specific local elements of the protein structure,
               maintain the correct energetic balance between functional
               conformations, and be compatible with the ancestral and derived
               structures--thus revealing why permissive mutations are rare.
               These findings demonstrate that GR evolution depended strongly
               on improbable, non-deterministic events, and this contingency
               arose from intrinsic biophysical properties of the protein.",

               evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because they
               involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never
               rise above extremely low frequencies in the population. To
               observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we
               constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage
               tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to
               monitor the relative frequencies of ∼500,000 lineages
               simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that
               the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is
               neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a
               predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly
               reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon
               outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in
               variability between replicates. These results suggest that early
               evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time
               before stochastic effects become important. Random DNA barcodes
               were used to simultaneously track hundreds of thousands of
               lineages in large cell populations, revealing deterministic
               dynamics early in their evolution. The dynamics underlying the

               They find that although individual mutations occur at random,
               the early dynamics of the population as a whole is a predictable
               outcome of the population size and the distribution of mutation

  abstract = "Therapies that target signalling molecules that are mutated in
              cancers can often have substantial short-term effects, but the
              emergence of resistant cancer cells is a major barrier to full
              cures. Resistance can result from secondary mutations, but in
              other cases there is no clear genetic cause, raising the
              possibility of non-genetic rare cell variability. Here we show
              that human melanoma cells can display profound transcriptional
              variability at the single-cell level that predicts which cells
              will ultimately resist drug treatment. This variability involves
              infrequent, semi-coordinated transcription of a number of
              resistance markers at high levels in a very small percentage of
              cells. The addition of drug then induces epigenetic reprogramming
              in these cells, converting the transient transcriptional state to
              a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins with a loss
              of SOX10-mediated differentiation followed by activation of new
              signalling pathways, partially mediated by the activity of the
              transcription factors JUN and/or AP-1 and TEAD. Our work reveals
              the multistage nature of the acquisition of drug resistance and
              provides a framework for understanding resistance dynamics in
              single cells. We find that other cell types also exhibit sporadic
              expression of many of these same marker genes, suggesting the

              dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes.
              Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve
              experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome

              signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the
              experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously
              competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between
              ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as
              long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most
              populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also
              present evidence that the targets of natural selection change

              strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results

              genotypes with improved performance in all measured traits,
              perhaps indicating an absence of trade-offs at least in the short

              debated. Evolution experiments under invariant laboratory
              conditions typically show a higher rate of nonsynonymous
              nucleotide changes than the rate of synonymous changes,
              demonstrating prevalent molecular adaptations. Natural evolution
              inferred from genomic comparisons, however, almost always
              exhibits the opposite pattern even among closely related
              conspecifics, which is indicative of a paucity of positive
              selection. Here we hypothesize that this apparent contradiction
              is at least in part attributable to ubiquitous and frequent
              environmental changes in nature, causing nonsynonymous mutations
              that are beneficial at one time to become deleterious soon after

              measured their fitness across multiple conditions. We found that

              driven by multiple types of mutations. Approximately 60\% of this

              difficult to evaluate in clinical tumours. Here, we demonstrate
              that faster division on the tumour periphery leaves
              characteristic genetic patterns, which become evident when a
              phylogenetic tree is reconstructed from spatially sampled cells.
              Namely, rapidly dividing peripheral lineages branch more
              extensively and acquire more mutations than slower-dividing
              centre lineages. We develop a Bayesian state-dependent
              evolutionary phylodynamic model (SDevo) that quantifies these
              patterns to infer the differential division rates between

              treatments, with impressive gains in on-treatment survival but
              more modest improvements in overall survival. Melanoma presents
              heterogeneity and transcriptional plasticity that recapitulates
              distinct melanocyte developmental states and phenotypes, allowing
              it to adapt to and eventually escape even the most advanced
              treatments. Despite remarkable advances in our understanding of
              melanoma biology and genetics, the melanoma cell of origin is
              still fiercely debated because both melanocyte stem cells and
              mature melanocytes can be transformed. Animal models and
              high-throughput single-cell sequencing approaches have opened new
              opportunities to address this question. Here, we discuss the
              melanocytic journey from the neural crest, where they emerge as
              melanoblasts, to the fully mature pigmented melanocytes resident
              in several tissues. We describe a new understanding of melanocyte
              biology and the different melanocyte subpopulations and
              microenvironments they inhabit, and how this provides unique
              insights into melanoma initiation and progression. We highlight
              recent findings on melanoma heterogeneity and transcriptional
              plasticity and their implications for exciting new research areas
              and treatment opportunities. The lessons from melanocyte biology
              reveal how cells that are present to protect us from the damaging

              selection mechanism to optimize tissue and organ development, its

              imaging, lineage tracing, single-cell transcriptomics and

              dynamics determine the outcomes of adaptation, but have been
              difficult to observe directly. Previous studies have used
              whole-genome sequencing to follow molecular adaptation6-10;
              however, these methods have limited resolution in microbial
              populations. Here we introduce a renewable barcoding system to
              observe evolutionary dynamics at high resolution in laboratory
              budding yeast. We find nested patterns of interference and
              hitchhiking even at low frequencies. These events are driven by
              the continuous appearance of new mutations that modify the fates
              of existing lineages before they reach substantial frequencies.
              We observe how the distribution of fitness within the population
              changes over time, and find a travelling wave of adaptation that
              has been predicted by theory11-17. We show that clonal
              competition creates a dynamical 'rich-get-richer' effect: fitness
              advantages that are acquired early in evolution drive clonal
              expansions, which increase the chances of acquiring future
              mutations. However, less-fit lineages also routinely leapfrog

              the origins and consequences of tissue architecture during
              tumorigenesis remain elusive. In skin, premalignant basal cell
              carcinomas form 'buds', while invasive squamous cell carcinomas
              initiate as 'folds'. Here, using computational modelling, genetic
              manipulations and biophysical measurements, we identify the
              biophysical underpinnings and biological consequences of these
              tumour architectures. Cell proliferation and actomyosin
              contractility dominate tissue architectures in monolayer, but not
              multilayer, epithelia. In stratified epidermis, meanwhile,
              softening and enhanced remodelling of the basement membrane
              promote tumour budding, while stiffening of the basement membrane
              promotes folding. Additional key forces stem from the
              stratification and differentiation of progenitor cells.
              Tumour-specific suprabasal stiffness gradients are generated as
              oncogenic lesions progress towards malignancy, which we
              computationally predict will alter extensile tensions on the
              tumour basement membrane. The pathophysiologic ramifications of
              this prediction are profound. Genetically decreasing the
              stiffness of basement membranes increases membrane tensions in
              silico and potentiates the progression of invasive squamous cell
              carcinomas in vivo. Our findings suggest that mechanical
              forces-exerted from above and below progenitors of multilayered

              obstacle in the context of normal human skin, thus offering a
              glimpse into the genomic landscapes of individual melanocytes
              from human skin. As expected, sun-shielded melanocytes had fewer
              mutations than sun-exposed melanocytes. However, melanocytes from
              chronically sun-exposed skin (for example, the face) had a lower
              mutation burden than melanocytes from intermittently sun-exposed
              skin (for example, the back). Melanocytes located adjacent to a
              skin cancer had higher mutation burdens than melanocytes from
              donors without skin cancer, implying that the mutation burden of
              normal skin can be used to measure cumulative sun damage and risk
              of skin cancer. Moreover, melanocytes from healthy skin commonly
              contained pathogenic mutations, although these mutations tended
              to be weakly oncogenic, probably explaining why they did not give
              rise to discernible lesions. Phylogenetic analyses identified

              programmes in the cell of origin. Here we define anatomic
              position as a major determinant of why cells respond to specific
              oncogenes. Cutaneous melanoma arises throughout the body, whereas
              the acral subtype arises on the palms of the hands, soles of the
              feet or under the nails3. We sequenced the DNA of cutaneous and
              acral melanomas from a large cohort of human patients and found a
              specific enrichment for BRAF mutations in cutaneous melanoma and
              enrichment for CRKL amplifications in acral melanoma. We modelled
              these changes in transgenic zebrafish models and found that
              CRKL-driven tumours formed predominantly in the fins of the fish.
              The fins are the evolutionary precursors to tetrapod limbs,
              indicating that melanocytes in these acral locations may be
              uniquely susceptible to CRKL. RNA profiling of these fin and limb

              positional identity gene programme typified by posterior HOX13
              genes. This positional gene programme synergized with CRKL to
              amplify insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling and drive
              tumours at acral sites. Abrogation of this CRKL-driven programme
              eliminated the anatomic specificity of acral melanoma. These data

              differences3-6 and immunoediting of neoantigens7,8; however, to
              our knowledge, no existing model weighs the relative contribution
              of these features to tumour evolution. We propose a unified
              theoretical 'free fitness' framework that parsimoniously
              integrates multimodal genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and
              proteomic data into a biophysical model of the rate-limiting
              processes underlying the fitness advantage conferred on cancer
              cells by driver gene mutations. Focusing on TP53, the most
              mutated gene in cancer1, we present an inference of mutant p53
              concentration and demonstrate that TP53 hotspot mutations
              optimally solve an evolutionary trade-off between oncogenic
              potential and neoantigen immunogenicity. Our model anticipates
              patient survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas and patients with
              lung cancer treated with immunotherapy as well as the age of
              tumour onset in germline carriers of TP53 variants. The predicted
              differential immunogenicity between hotspot mutations was
              validated experimentally in patients with cancer and in a unique
              large dataset of healthy individuals. Our data indicate that
              immune selective pressure on TP53 mutations has a smaller role in
              non-cancerous lesions than in tumours, suggesting that targeted
              immunotherapy may offer an early prophylactic opportunity for the
              former. Determining the relative contribution of immunogenicity
              and oncogenic function to the selective advantage of hotspot
              mutations thus has important implications for both precision
              immunotherapies and our understanding of tumour evolution.",

               Allele-specific expression can also result in
               genomic--transcriptomic parallel evolution, which converges on
               cancer gene disruption. We extract signatures of RNA single-base

              cancers2-6, but the basis of their fitness advantage remains
              largely unknown, partly owing to a paucity of large cohorts in
              which the clonal expansion rate has been assessed by longitudinal
              sampling. Here, to circumvent this limitation, we developed a
              method to infer the expansion rate from data from a single time
              point. We applied this method to 5,071 people with clonal
              haematopoiesis. A genome-wide association study revealed that a
              common inherited polymorphism in the TCL1A promoter was
              associated with a slower expansion rate in clonal haematopoiesis
              overall, but the effect varied by driver gene. Those carrying
              this protective allele exhibited markedly reduced growth rates or
              prevalence of clones with driver mutations in TET2, ASXL1, SF3B1
              and SRSF2, but this effect was not seen in clones with driver
              mutations in DNMT3A. TCL1A was not expressed in normal or
              DNMT3A-mutated HSCs, but the introduction of mutations in TET2 or
              ASXL1 led to the expression of TCL1A protein and the expansion of
              HSCs in vitro. The protective allele restricted TCL1A expression
              and expansion of mutant HSCs, as did experimental knockdown of
              TCL1A expression. Forced expression of TCL1A promoted the
              expansion of human HSCs in vitro and mouse HSCs in vivo. Our
              results indicate that the fitness advantage of several commonly
              mutated driver genes in clonal haematopoiesis may be mediated by

              on DNA-conjugated antibodies and the cyclic addition and removal

              used so far to simultaneously visualize up to 60 markers in situ.
              CODEX enables a deep view into the single-cell spatial
              relationships in tissues and is intended to spur discovery in
              developmental biology, disease and therapeutic design. Herein, we

              insertions and deletions in cells and animals without requiring
              double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). The mechanism of PE makes it
              less dependent on cellular replication and endogenous DNA repair
              than homology-directed repair-based approaches, and its ability
              to precisely install edits without creating DSBs minimizes indels
              and other undesired outcomes. The capabilities of PE have also
              expanded since its original publication. Enhanced PE systems, PE4
              and PE5, manipulate DNA repair pathways to increase PE efficiency
              and reduce indels. Other advances that improve PE efficiency
              include engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs), which include a structured
              RNA motif to stabilize and protect pegRNA 3' ends, and the PEmax
              architecture, which improves editor expression and nuclear
              localization. New applications such as twin PE (twinPE) can
              precisely insert or delete hundreds of base pairs of DNA and can
              be used in tandem with recombinases to achieve gene-sized (>5 kb)

              experimental design, and the large number of parameters that

              conditions, permitted the exclusion of the confounding variables
              that frequently complicate transcriptome analyses. This approach
              allowed us to dissect out effects on gene expression that are
              specific to particular physiological states. Thus, we discovered
              that a large number of ORFs involved in protein synthesis were
              activated under ammonium limitation, whereas the expression of
              ORFs concerned with energy and metabolism was enhanced by carbon
              limitation. Elevated transcription of genes in high-affinity
              glucose uptake, the trichloroacetic acid cycle, and oxidative
              phosphorylation were observed in glucose-limiting, but not
              glucose-abundant, conditions. In contrast, genes involved in
              gluconeogenesis and, interestingly, genes subject to nitrogen

              commonplace evolutionary hypothesis that adaptation, increased
              fitness within the selective environment, is accompanied by
              trade-off, a loss of fitness in other nonselective environments.
              Specifically, we determined whether trade-offs at high
              temperature generally and necessarily accompany genetic
              adaptation to low temperature. We measured the relative fitness
              increment of 24 lineages of the bacterium Escherichia coli
              evolved for 2,000 generations at 20 degrees C and the relative
              fitness decrement of these lines at 40 degrees C. Trade-offs at
              the higher temperature were examined for their generality,
              universality, quantitative relationship, and historical
              contingency. Considering all 24 lines as a group, a significant
              decline in fitness was found at 40 degrees C (mean decline =
              9.4\%), indicating the generality of the trade-off effect.
              However, in a lineage-by-lineage analysis, only 15 of 24 showed a
              significant trade-off, and one lineage increased fitness at high
              temperature. Thus, although general, trade-offs were not
              universal. Furthermore, there was no quantitative association
              between the magnitude of adaptive fitness increment at 20 degrees
              C and fitness decline at 40 degrees C, and no effect of lineages'
              historical thermal environment on either their improvement at 20
              degrees C or the extent of their trade-off at high temperature.
              We do not yet know the underlying mechanisms responsible for the
              trade-off, but they are sufficiently prevalent to drive a general
              effect. However, approximately one-third of the experimental
              lineages achieved low-temperature adaptation without detectable
              high-temperature trade-offs; therefore, it cannot be necessary
              that every change conferring benefit in cold environments has a

  abstract = "The role of historical contingency in evolution has been much
              debated, but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical
              populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to
              investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a
              glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli
              cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No
              population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for >30,000
              generations, although each population tested billions of
              mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one
              population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in
              population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique
              evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some
              extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary
              mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic
              expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population.
              We tested these hypotheses in experiments that ``replayed''
              evolution from different points in that population's history. We
              observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 x 10(12) ancestral cells, nor
              among 9 x 10(12) cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000
              generations. However, we observed a significantly greater
              tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some
              potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This
              potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did
              not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of

              senescence (irreversible loss of proliferative potential and
              senescent morphology). p53 can also cause reversible arrest
              without senescent morphology, which has usually been interpreted
              as failure of p53 to induce senescence. Here we demonstrate that
              p53-induced quiescence actually results from suppression of
              senescence by p53. In previous studies, suppression of senescence
              by p53 was masked by p53-induced cell cycle arrest. Here, we
              separated these two activities by inducing senescence through
              overexpression of p21 and then testing the effect of p53 on
              senescence. We found that in p21-arrested cells, p53 converted
              senescence into quiescence. Suppression of senescence by p53
              required its transactivation function. Like rapamycin, which is
              known to suppress senescence, p53 inhibited the mTOR pathway. We
              suggest that, while inducing cell cycle arrest, p53 may
              simultaneously suppress the senescence program, thus causing
              quiescence and that suppression of senescence and induction of
              cell cycle arrest are distinct functions of p53. Thus, in spite
              of its ability to induce cell cycle arrest, p53 can act as a
              suppressor of cellular senescence.",

  abstract = "AbstractMany organisms are specialized, and these narrow niches
              are often explained with trade-offs-the inability for one
              organism to express maximal performance in two or more
              environments. However, evidence is lacking that trade-offs are
              sufficient to explain specialists. Several lines of theoretical
              inquiry suggest that populations can specialize without explicit
              trade-offs, as a result of relaxed selection in generalists for
              their performance in rare environments. Here, I synthesize and
              extend these approaches, showing that emergent asymmetries in
              evolvability can push a population toward specialization in the
              absence of trade-offs and in the presence of substantial
              ecological costs of specialism. Simulations are used to
              demonstrate how adaptation to a more common environment
              interferes with adaptation to a less common but otherwise equal
              alternative environment and that this interference is greatly
              exacerbated at low recombination rates. This adaptive process of
              specialization can effectively trap populations in a suboptimal
              niche. These modeling results predict that transient differences
              in evolvability across traits during a single episode of

              regulation. In yeast, expression of the CIT2 gene shows a typical
              retrograde response in that its expression is dramatically
              increased in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria, such as in
              rho(o) petites. Three genes control this signaling pathway: RTG1
              and RTG3, which encode basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper
              transcription factors that bind as heterodimer to the CIT2

              calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population

              common route to adaptation in experimental evolution of haploid
              budding yeast populations. The rate at which autodiploids fix in
              these populations appears to vary across strain backgrounds, but
              the genetic basis of these differences remains poorly
              characterized. Here, we show that the frequency of
              autodiploidization differs dramatically between two closely
              related laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BY4741
              and W303. To investigate the genetic basis of this difference, we
              crossed these strains to generate hundreds of unique F1
              segregants and tested the tendency of each segregant to
              autodiplodize across hundreds of generations of laboratory
              evolution. We find that variants in the SSD1 gene are the primary
              genetic determinant of differences in autodiploidization. We then
              used multiple laboratory and wild strains of S. cerevisiae to
              show that clonal populations of strains with a functional copy of
              SSD1 autodiploidize more frequently in evolution experiments,
              while knocking out this gene or replacing it with the W303 allele
              reduces autodiploidization propensity across all genetic
              backgrounds tested. These results suggest a potential strategy

  abstract = "Morphospaces-representations of phenotypic characteristics-are
              often populated unevenly, leaving large parts unoccupied. Such
              patterns are typically ascribed to contingency, or else to
              natural selection disfavoring certain parts of the morphospace.
              The extent to which developmental bias, the tendency of certain
              phenotypes to preferentially appear as potential variation, also
              explains these patterns is hotly debated. Here we demonstrate
              quantitatively that developmental bias is the primary explanation
              for the occupation of the morphospace of RNA secondary structure
              (SS) shapes. Upon random mutations, some RNA SS shapes (the
              frequent ones) are much more likely to appear than others. By
              using the RNAshapes method to define coarse-grained SS classes,
              we can directly compare the frequencies that noncoding RNA SS
              shapes appear in the RNAcentral database to frequencies obtained
              upon a random sampling of sequences. We show that: 1) only the
              most frequent structures appear in nature; the vast majority of
              possible structures in the morphospace have not yet been
              explored; 2) remarkably small numbers of random sequences are
              needed to produce all the RNA SS shapes found in nature so far;
              and 3) perhaps most surprisingly, the natural frequencies are
              accurately predicted, over several orders of magnitude in
              variation, by the likelihood that structures appear upon a
              uniform random sampling of sequences. The ultimate cause of these
              patterns is not natural selection, but rather a strong phenotype
              bias in the RNA genotype-phenotype map, a type of developmental
              bias or ``findability constraint,'' which limits evolutionary
              dynamics to a hugely reduced subset of structures that are easy
              to ``find.''",

              proliferation and survival of cancer cell lineages. Increases in
              proliferation and survival are mediated by natural selection,
              which can be quantified by comparing the frequency at which we
              detect substitutions to the frequency at which we expect to
              detect substitutions assuming neutrality. Most of the variants
              detectable with whole-exome sequencing in tumors are neutral or
              nearly neutral in effect, and thus the processes generating the
              majority of mutations may not be the primary sources of the
              tumorigenic mutations. Across 24 cancer types, we identify the

              have claimed that clonal interference makes mutation-biased
              adaptation rare. We consider the behaviour of two simultaneously
              adapting traits, one with larger mutation rate U, the other with
              larger selection coefficient s, using asexual travelling wave
              models. We find that adaptation is dominated by whichever trait
              has the faster rate of adaptation v in isolation, with the other
              trait subject to evolutionary stalling. Reviewing empirical
              claims for mutation-biased adaptation, we find that not all occur
              in the 'origin-fixation' regime of population genetics where v is

              genetic basis and ecological consequences of adaptive mutations
              remain rare. Here, we characterize the direct and pleiotropic
              fitness effects of a collection of 21 first-step beneficial
              mutants derived from na{\"\i}ve and adapted genotypes used in a

              Whole-genome sequencing was used to identify most beneficial

              these mutations were predominantly positive but some mutants were

              fitness effects of mutations derived from the adapted genotypes

              clones exposed to anti-cancer therapies. We show that resistant
              clones emerging from single-cell-derived cancer cells adopt
              molecularly, morphologically, and functionally distinct fate
              types. These different resistant types are largely predetermined
              by molecular differences between cells before addition of drug
              and not by extrinsic cell-specific microenvironmental factors.
              Changes in dose and kind of drug can, however, switch the
              resistant fate type of an initial cell, even resulting in the
              generation and elimination of certain fate types. Diversity in
              resistant fates was observed across several single-cell-derived
              cancer cell lines and types treated with a variety of drugs. Cell
              fate diversity as a result of variability in intrinsic cell
              states may be a generic feature of response to external cues.

              for modern medicine from infectious diseases to cancers. Many of
              these resistance-conferring mutations often carry a substantial
              fitness cost in the absence of treatment. As a result, we would
              expect these mutants to undergo purifying selection and be
              rapidly driven to extinction. Nevertheless, pre-existing
              resistance is frequently observed from drug-resistant malaria to
              targeted cancer therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
              and melanoma. Solutions to this apparent paradox have taken
              several forms from spatial rescue to simple mutation supply
              arguments. Recently, in an evolved resistant NSCLC cell line, we
              found that frequency-dependent ecological interactions between
              ancestor and mutant ameliorate the cost of resistance in the
              absence of treatment. Here, we hypothesize that
              frequency-dependent ecological interactions in general may play a
              major role in the prevalence of pre-existing resistance. We
              combine numerical simulations with robust analytical
              approximations to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for
              studying the effects of frequency-dependent ecological
              interactions on the evolutionary dynamics of pre-existing
              resistance. First, we find that ecological interactions
              significantly expand the parameter regime under which we expect
              to observe pre-existing resistance. Even when positive ecological
              interactions between mutants and ancestors are rare, these clones
              provide the primary mode of evolved resistance because their
              positive interaction leads to significantly longer extinction
              times. Next, we find that even in the case where mutation supply
              is sufficient to predict pre-existing resistance,
              frequency-dependent ecological forces still contribute a strong
              evolutionary pressure that selects for increasingly positive
              ecological effects. Finally, we genetically engineer several of
              the most common clinically observed resistance mechanisms to
              targeted therapies in NSCLC, a treatment notorious for
              pre-existing resistance, and where our theory predicts positive
              ecological interactions to be common. We find that all three
              engineered mutants display a positive ecological interaction with
              their ancestor, as predicted. Strikingly, as with our originally
              evolved resistant mutant, two of the three engineered mutants
              have ecological interactions that fully compensate for their
              substantial fitness costs. As a whole, these results suggest that
              frequency-dependent ecological effects may provide the primary
              mode by which pre-existing resistance emerges. \#\#\# Competing

              determine how tumor heterogeneity shapes the immune
              microenvironment and impacts responses to therapy, we modeled
              heterogeneous tumors comprised of a pro-inflammatory (``hot'')
              and an immunosuppressive (``cold'') tumor population. This was
              done by mixing two squamous skin carcinoma cell lines that alone
              give rise to tumors with a reproducible immunologically ``hot''
              or ``cold'' immune phenotype respectively, and labeling these
              with YFP or RFP fluorescent tags to enable precise spatial
              tracking. The resulting mixed-population tumors were made up of a
              patchwork of distinct regions that could be classified as being
              comprised of YFP+ (``hot'') cells, RFP+ (``cold'') cells, or a

              regions---were of low abundance throughout the heterogeneous
              tumors. We identify the chemokine Cx3cl1, produced at higher
              levels by our ``cold'' tumors, as a mediator of intratumoral
              macrophage abundance, and show that overexpression of Cx3cl1 in
              pro-inflammatory (``hot'') tumor cells leads to an increase in
              immunosuppressive CD206Hi macrophages. We further interrogated
              the impact of this spatial patterning of immune cells on the
              responses of heterogeneous tumors to checkpoint blockade. We find
              that combination of PD-1 blockade and CD40 agonist is able to
              increase the Th1 response in ``cold'' RFP regions, however the T
              cell response in ``cold'' regions remains inferior to ``hot''
              regions and treatment achieves only a modest reduction in tumor
              growth. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the spatial
              organization of heterogeneous tumor cells has a profound impact
              on directing the spatial organization and function of
              tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as on responses to

              of its very large number of cells, the bowhead is not highly
              cancer-prone, an incongruity termed Peto's Paradox. This has been
              explained by the evolution of additional tumor suppressor genes
              in larger animals, which is supported by research on elephants
              demonstrating expansion of the p53 gene. However, we show here
              that bowhead whale fibroblasts undergo oncogenic transformation
              after disruption of fewer tumor suppressors than required for
              human fibroblasts. Instead, analysis of DNA repair revealed that
              bowhead cells repair double-strand breaks with uniquely high

              This strategy that does not eliminate cells but repairs them may
              be critical for the long and cancer-free lifespan of the bowhead

              replicating within the cancer genome through retrotransposition,
              or presenting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to
              the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune

              evolution and shape the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) in a
              pro- or anti-tumorigenic manner remains poorly defined. Here, we
              integrate whole genome and total transcriptome data from a unique
              autopsy cohort of multiregional samples collected in pancreatic
              ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, into a comprehensive
              evolutionary analysis. We find that more recently evolved S hort
              I nterspersed N uclear E lements (SINE), a family of
              retrotransposable repeats, are more likely to form
              immunostimulatory double-strand RNAs (dsRNAs). Consequently,
              younger SINEs are strongly co-regulated with RIG-I like receptor
              associated type-I interferon genes but anti-correlated with
              pro-tumorigenic macrophage infiltration. We discover that

              Moreover, L1 retrotransposition activity tracks with tumor
              evolution and is associated with TP53 mutation status.
              Altogether, our results suggest pancreatic tumors actively evolve
              to modulate immunogenic SINE stress and induce pro-tumorigenic
              inflammation. Our integrative, evolutionary analysis therefore
              illustrates, for the first time, how dark matter genomic repeats
              enable tumors to co-evolve with the TME by actively regulating

              cells vary in their proliferative capacity, the cell states
              underlying these differences are yet to be uncovered. Here we
              performed clonal tracing through imaging and cellular barcoding
              of an in vitro model of esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT).
              We found that individual clones possess unique growth and
              differentiation capacities, with a subset of clones growing
              exponentially. Further, we discovered that this proliferative

              infection with virus. Here, we used single-cell clone tracing to
              retrospectively identify and characterize lung epithelial cells

              found in normal tissue can contribute to tumorigenesis is
              limited: common somatic mutations may or may not confer
              phenotypes compatible with oncogenesis. However, the strength of
              selection for somatic variants that appear in both normal and
              cancer tissues can be quantified in each context using
              evolutionary modeling approaches. We studied the evolutionary
              trajectory from normal esophageal tissue to esophageal
              squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) by analysis of 2171 sequenced
              samples from previous studies on normal esophageal epithelium and
              ESCC to reveal the stepwise contributions of somatic mutations to
              increased cellular division and survival. We also analyzed
              pairwise selective epistasis between somatically mutated genes
              that may lead to stepwise substitution patterns. We found that
              NOTCH1 substitutions are highly selected along the trajectory
              from embryogenesis to adult normal esophageal tissue, explaining
              their high prevalence in the tissue. In contrast, there is little
              to no positive selection for NOTCH1 mutations along the
              trajectory from adult normal tissue to ESCC, suggesting that
              NOTCH1 substitutions do not drive tumorigenesis. Furthermore,
              mutations in NOTCH1 exhibit antagonistic epistasis with
              well-known cancer drivers including TP53, reducing selection for
              progressive mutations in tumorigenesis. This antagonistic
              epistasis likely corresponds with a low likelihood of tumor
              progression in the presence of NOTCH1 mutations in the esophagus.

              Various biotic and abiotic factors come together to produce a
              complex environment to which populations must adapt. How
              populations adapt to multiple stressors simultaneously, and how
              trade-offs evolve between these stressors has been of interest to
              evolutionary biologists for decades. But natural populations
              often present logistical challenges to understanding the dynamics
              of evolution and isolating the genetic basis of adaptation. Here
              we use methods in experimental evolution to test how adaptation
              proceeds in the presence of co-occurring stressors, and to
              quantify the evolution of trade-offs between stressors in a
              complex environment. We adapted populations of the yeast
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a full-factorial combination of four
              stressors over the course of 15 serial transfers. We observed
              rapid increases in fitness paired with the accumulation of
              mutations related to specific stressors. Trade-offs evolved
              rapidly and dynamics of trade-off evolution varied between
              stressors, likely due to the inherent physiological and genetic
              basis of resistance to each stressor. The degree of parallelism
              at the phenotypic level showed evidence of being modified by the

              these candidates in vivo is challenging, due to low efficiency
              and low throughput of most model systems. This is especially the
              case in skin cells such as melanocytes, where the background
              mutation rate is high. We have developed a rapid and scalable
              system for assessing the role of candidate genes in a melanocyte
              specific manner using zebrafish. We generated transgenic
              zebrafish in which Cas9 was knocked-in to the endogenous mitfa
              locus, a master transcription factor of the melanocyte lineage.
              By introducing single guide RNA expression cassettes into
              mitfaCas9 embryos, we were able to achieve highly efficient
              melanocyte-specific mutation of genes important for melanocyte
              patterning and survival. These animals can be used to screen for
              dominant or recessive pigment defects in both the F0 generation
              (3 days) and F1 generation (3 months). We also utilized the
              mitfaCas9 line to study the role of melanoma genetic dependencies
              such as SOX10, demonstrating that loss of SOX10 reduces melanoma
              initiation yet promotes tumor progression by a switch to a SOX9hi
              state. This SOX10 to SOX9 switch has previously been observed in
              human patients, indicating that our system can be used to rapidly
              uncover biological states with relevance to human disease. Our

              ecological specialization, the maintenance of genetic variation,
              and sympatric speciation, yet relatively few experiments have
              examined costs of generalism over long-term adaptation. We tested
              whether selection in environments containing two resources limits
              a population's ability to adapt to the individual resources by
              comparing the fitness of replicate Escherichia coli populations
              evolved for 6000 generations in the presence of glucose or
              lactose alone (specialists), or in varying presentations of
              glucose and lactose together (generalists). We found that all
              populations had significant fitness increases in both resources,
              though the magnitude and rate of these increases differed. For
              the first 4000 generations, most generalist populations increased

              corresponding specialist populations. From 5000 generations,
              however, a widespread cost of adaptation affected all

              beneficial mutations. Studies that address both the genetic basis
              and ecological consequences of adaptive mutations remain rare.
              Here, we characterize the direct and pleiotropic fitness effects
              of a collection of 21 first-step beneficial mutants derived from
              na{\"\i}ve and adapted genotypes used in a long-term experimental

              organismal complexity--complex organisms adapt more slowly than
              simple ones when using mutations of the same phenotypic size.
              Thus, as Fisher foresaw, organisms pay a kind of cost of
              complexity. However, the magnitude of this cost is considerably

  abstract = "The problem of complex adaptations is studied in two largely
              disconnected research traditions: evolutionary biology and
              evolutionary computer science. This paper summarizes the results
              from both areas and compares their implications. In evolutionary
              computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of
              mutation, recombination and selection is not universally
              effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or
              chip designs. For adaptation to occur, these systems must possess
              ``evolvability,'' i.e., the ability of random variations to
              sometimes produce improvement. It was found that evolvability
              critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto
              phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation
              problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the variability of
              characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to
              be distinguished from variations, which are the actually realized
              differences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is
              the common theme underlying such varied biological phenomena as
              genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological
              versatility, developmental dissociability, and morphological
              integration. For evolutionary biology the representation problem
              has important implications: how is it that extant species
              acquired a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by
              mutation and selection? Is the genotype-phenotype map able to
              change in evolution? What are the selective forces, if any, that
              shape the genotype-phenotype map? We propose that the
              genotype-phenotype map can evolve by two main routes: epistatic
              mutations, or the creation of new genes. A common result for
              organismic design is modularity. By modularity we mean a
              genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic effects
              among characters serving different functions, with pleiotropic
              effects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single
              functional complex. Such a design is expected to improve
              evolvability by limiting the interference between the adaptation
              of different functions. Several population genetic models are
              reviewed that are intended to explain the evolutionary origin of
              a modular design. While our current knowledge is insufficient to
              assess the plausibility of these models, they form the beginning
              of a framework for understanding the evolution of the

              for interpreting tests of ecological trade-offs. We isolated

              generations from replicate experimental lineages that had been
              selected during 5000 generations in a glucose-limited

              on tolerance to Myc, which we implicate as a lineage-specific
              driver of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cell. Histological
              transformations are frequently accompanied by activation of the
              Akt pathway. Manipulating this pathway permitted tolerance to Myc
              as an oncogenic driver, producing rare, stem-like cells that
              transcriptionally resemble the pulmonary basal lineage. These
              findings suggest that histological transformation may require the
              plasticity inherent to the basal stem cell, enabling tolerance to
              previously incompatible oncogenic driver programs.",

               resistance and is associated with poor patient survival. Single
               cell sequencing of a series of transgenic zebrafish melanoma
               tumors revealed 3 distinct cell states that correspond to a
               neural crest, melanocyte or stress-like state. The existence of
               these 3 states was confirmed using spatial transcriptomics, a
               method that does not require tissue dissociation or cell
               sorting. The stress-like state expresses genes such as fos,
               hsp70 and ubb, proteins which are all required for adaptation to
               diverse cellular stresses. A transgenic reporter of the stress
               like state demonstrates that it has higher tumor seeding
               capabilities compared to non-stressed cells, and confers
               intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibitors, a commonly used melanoma
               therapeutic. The stress program can be induced by extrinsic
               processes such as heat shock, and confers resistance to MEK
               inhibitors in both zebrafish and human melanomas. Our study
               identifies a population of stress-like cells that are present
               from the time of tumor initiation, suggesting that the
               transcriptional seeds of therapeutic failure are established
               during the earliest steps of tumorigenesis. Citation Format:

               oncogenes and tumor suppressors are a hallmark of cancer. While
               molecular characterization of tens of thousands of primary
               tumors has solidified estimates of how frequently specific
               genomic alterations occur, identifying genetic interactions from
               co-mutation rates alone remains limited by the vast number of
               possible combinations as well as inherent biases and confounding
               effects. Conversely, genetically engineered mouse models can
               reliably uncover causal effects of specific genetic alterations
               but are not sufficiently high throughput to generate broad
               insights into the interplay between genetic alterations in
               tumors. Therefore, how the effects of one alteration on tumor
               growth change in the context of other alterations remains
               largely unknown. We previously addressed these technical
               limitations by combining CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing,
               tumor barcoding, and ultra-deep barcode sequencing methods with
               genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer, which
               together enable multiplexing of tumor genotypes in individual
               mice and precise, high-throughput quantification of in vivo
               tumor fitness. Here, we leverage this platform to systematically
               quantify the growth effects of over 45 known and putative tumor
               suppressor gene alterations across different common oncogenic
               point mutations in Kras and Braf. While the set of genes we
               identified as tumor suppressive in KrasG12D- and KrasG12C-driven
               lung cancers was largely consistent, inactivation of those genes
               typically resulted in larger tumor growth advantages in the
               KrasG12D model. Inactivation of most genes in BrafV600E-driven
               lung tumors had a strikingly different growth effect than in
               tumors with either Kras variant, and effects were generally far
               less pronounced in the BrafV600E context. Interestingly, loss of
               genes upstream of Braf within the Ras pathway often had strong
               effects in the KrasG12D or KrasG12C models---loss of Nf1, a
               negative regulator of Kras, or loss of the wildtype Kras allele
               enhanced oncogenic Kras-driven tumor growth, while loss of Shp2,
               a positive regulator of Kras, was mildly detrimental---but had
               little or no effects in the BrafV600E model. We assessed
               translatability of our experimental cause-and-effect data
               through comparisons to correlative data from publicly available
               human lung cancer genomics databases, and found that genetic
               interactions predicted by our models and gene co-mutation rates
               in patient tumors largely align. Together, these findings
               underscore the need for a contextual understanding of the ways
               in which tumors are influenced by their genetics and highlight

              However, most point mutations occur at low frequency, and the
              function of these alleles remains undefined. We have developed a
              scalable systematic approach to interrogate the function of
              cancer-associated gene variants. We subjected 474 mutant alleles
              curated from 5,338 tumors to pooled in vivo tumor formation
              assays and gene expression profiling. We identified 12
              transforming alleles, including two in genes (PIK3CB, POT1) that
              have not been shown to be tumorigenic. One rare KRAS allele,
              D33E, displayed tumorigenicity and constitutive activation of
              known RAS effector pathways. By comparing gene expression changes
              induced upon expression of wild-type and mutant alleles, we
              inferred the activity of specific alleles. Because alleles found
              to be mutated only once in 5,338 tumors rendered cells
              tumorigenic, these observations underscore the value of
              integrating genomic information with functional studies.
              SIGNIFICANCE: Experimentally inferring the functional status of
              cancer-associated mutations facilitates the interpretation of
              genomic information in cancer. Pooled in vivo screen and gene
              expression profiling identified functional variants and
              demonstrated that expression of rare variants induced
              tumorigenesis. Variant phenotyping through functional studies

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genetic barcoding provides a high-throughput way to
              simultaneously track the frequencies of large numbers of
              competing and evolving microbial lineages. However making
              inferences about the nature of the evolution that is taking place
              remains a difficult task. RESULTS: Here we describe an algorithm
              for the inference of fitness effects and establishment times of
              beneficial mutations from barcode sequencing data, which builds
              upon a Bayesian inference method by enforcing self-consistency
              between the population mean fitness and the individual effects of
              mutations within lineages. By testing our inference method on a
              simulation of 40,000 barcoded lineages evolving in serial batch
              culture, we find that this new method outperforms its
              predecessor, identifying more adaptive mutations and more
              accurately inferring their mutational parameters. CONCLUSION: Our
              new algorithm is particularly suited to inference of mutational
              parameters when read depth is low. We have made Python code for

              assays revealed that MALAT-1 does not shuttle between the nucleus
              and cytoplasm. RNAi-mediated repression of the nuclear speckle
              proteins, RNPS1, SRm160, or IBP160, which are well-known mRNA
              processing factors, resulted in the diffusion of MALAT-1 to the
              nucleoplasm. We demonstrated that MALAT-1 contains two distinct
              elements directing transcripts to nuclear speckles, which were
              also capable of binding to RNPS1 in vitro. Depletion of MALAT-1
              represses the expression of several genes. Taken together, our
              results suggest that RNPS1, SRm160, and IBP160 contribute to the
              localization of MALAT-1 to nuclear speckles, where MALAT-1 could
              be involved in regulating gene expression.",

              what course adaptation may follow and allow us to determine
              whether gene flow would be facilitated or hampered following
              secondary contact. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to measure
              the genetic interactions between first-step mutations that
              independently evolved in the same biosynthetic pathway following
              exposure to the fungicide nystatin. We found that genetic
              interactions are prevalent and predominantly negative, with the
              majority of mutations causing lower growth when combined in a
              double mutant than when alone as a single mutant (sign
              epistasis). The prevalence of sign epistasis is surprising given
              the small number of mutations tested and runs counter to
              expectations for mutations arising in a single biosynthetic
              pathway in the face of a simple selective pressure. Furthermore,
              in one third of pairwise interactions, the double mutant grew
              less well than either single mutant (reciprocal sign epistasis).
              The observation of reciprocal sign epistasis among these first
              adaptive mutations arising in the same genetic background
              indicates that partial postzygotic reproductive isolation could
              evolve rapidly between populations under similar selective
              pressures, even with only a single genetic change in each. The
              nature of the epistatic relationships was sensitive, however, to

              concentrations of nystatin. We discuss the implications of these

               treatment. Different cancer patients may involve different
               combinations of gene mutations or the distinct regulatory
               pathways for inducing the progression of tumor. Investigating
               the pathways of gene mutations which can cause the formation of
               tumor can provide a basis for the personalized treatment of
               cancer. Studies suggested that KRAS, APC and TP53 are the most
               significant driver genes for colorectal cancer. However, it is
               still an open issue regarding the detailed mutation order of
               these genes in the development of colorectal cancer. For this
               purpose, we analyze the mathematical model considering all
               orders of mutations in oncogene, KRAS and tumor suppressor
               genes, APC and TP53, and fit it on data describing the incidence
               rates of colorectal cancer at different age from the
               Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry in the United
               States for the year 1973--2013. The specific orders that can
               induce the development of colorectal cancer are identified by
               the model fitting. The fitting results indicate that the
               mutation orders with KRAS $\rightarrow$ APC $\rightarrow$ TP53,
               APC $\rightarrow$ TP53 $\rightarrow$ KRAS and APC $\rightarrow$

               $\rightarrow$ TP53 $\rightarrow$ KRAS and APC $\rightarrow$ KRAS

  abstract = "One of the central goals of evolutionary biology is to explain
              and predict the molecular basis of adaptive evolution. We studied
              the evolution of genetic networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              (budding yeast) populations propagated for more than 200
              generations in different nitrogen-limiting conditions. We find
              that rapid adaptive evolution in nitrogen-poor environments is
              dominated by the de novo generation and selection of copy number
              variants (CNVs), a large fraction of which contain genes encoding
              specific nitrogen transporters including PUT4, DUR3 and DAL4. The
              large fitness increases associated with these alleles limits the
              genetic heterogeneity of adapting populations even in
              environments with multiple nitrogen sources. Complete
              identification of acquired point mutations, in individual
              lineages and entire populations, identified heterogeneity at the
              level of genetic loci but common themes at the level of
              functional modules, including genes controlling
              phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate metabolism and vacuole
              biogenesis. Adaptive strategies shared with other
              nutrient-limited environments point to selection of genetic
              variation in the TORC1 and Ras/PKA signaling pathways as a
              general mechanism underlying improved growth in nutrient-limited
              environments. Within a single population we observed the repeated
              independent selection of a multi-locus genotype, comprised of the
              functionally related genes GAT1, MEP2 and LST4. By studying the
              fitness of individual alleles, and their combination, as well as
              the evolutionary history of the evolving population, we find that
              the order in which these mutations are acquired is constrained by
              epistasis. The identification of repeatedly selected variation at
              functionally related loci that interact epistatically suggests
              that gene network polymorphisms (GNPs) may be a frequent outcome
              of adaptive evolution. Our results provide insight into the
              mechanistic basis by which cells adapt to nutrient-limited
              environments and suggest that knowledge of the selective
              environment and the regulatory mechanisms important for growth

              therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat disease. While static

              into the biological bases of diseases, it makes differentiating
              the causative from the correlative effects difficult, as the

              expression dynamics in the presence of a causal variant as the
              sole genetic determinant, and performed allele-specific
              functional validation to delineate the causal effects of the
              genetic variant on the phenotype. Here, we characterized the
              precise genetic effects of a functional MKT1 allelic variant in

              meiotic landmark events and conditional activation of MKT1
              expression during sporulation specified an early meiotic role of
              this variant. By analyzing the early meiotic genome-wide
              transcriptional response, we demonstrate an MKT1-dependent role
              of novel modulators, namely, RTG1/3, regulators of mitochondrial
              retrograde signaling, and DAL82, regulator of nitrogen
              starvation, in additively effecting sporulation efficiency. In
              the presence of functional MKT1 allele, better respiration during
              early sporulation was observed, which was dependent on the
              mitochondrial retrograde regulator, RTG3. Furthermore, our
              approach showed that MKT1 contributes to sporulation independent
              of Puf3, an RNA-binding protein that steady-state transcription
              profiling studies have suggested to mediate MKT1-pleiotropic
              effects during mitotic growth. These results uncover interesting
              regulatory links between meiosis and mitochondrial retrograde
              signaling. In this study, we highlight the advantage of analyzing
              allele-specific transcriptional dynamics of mediating genes.

              initially focused on nc-mitochondrial mRNAs known to be enriched
              in monosomes in a glucose-rich environment. We unexpectedly found
              that one of the monosome-enriched mRNAs, CAT5/COQ7 mRNA, directly
              interacts with Puf3p through its non-canonical Puf3p binding
              sequence, which is generally less considered as a Puf3p binding
              site. Western blot analysis showed that Puf3p represses
              translation of Cat5p, regardless of culture in fermentable or
              respiratory medium. In vitro binding assay confirmed Puf3p's
              direct interaction with CAT5 mRNA via this non-canonical
              Puf3p-binding site. Although cat5 mutants of the non-canonical
              Puf3p-binding site grow normally, Cat5p expression is altered,
              indicating that CAT5 mRNA is a bona fide Puf3p target with
              additional regulatory factors acting through this sequence.
              Unlike other yeast PUF proteins, Puf3p uniquely regulates Cat5p
              by destabilizing mRNA and repressing translation, shedding new
              light on an unknown part of the Puf3p regulatory network. Given
              that pathological variants of human COQ7 lead to CoQ10 deficiency
              and yeast cat5$\Delta$ can be complemented by hCOQ7, our findings
              may also offer some insights into clinical aspects of
              COQ7-related disorders.",

              of individual mutations, yet the impact of these epistatic
              interactions on evolutionary dynamics remains poorly understood.
              Here we investigate the evolutionary role of epistasis over
              50,000 generations in a well-studied laboratory evolution
              experiment in Escherichia coli. The extensive duration of this
              experiment provides a unique window into the effects of epistasis
              during long-term adaptation to a constant environment. Guided by
              analytical results in the weak-mutation limit, we develop a
              computational framework to assess the compatibility of a given
              epistatic model with the observed patterns of fitness gain and
              mutation accumulation through time. We find that a decelerating
              fitness trajectory alone provides little power to distinguish
              between competing models, including those that lack any direct
              epistatic interactions between mutations. However, when combined
              with the mutation trajectory, these observables place strong
              constraints on the set of possible models of epistasis, ruling
              out many existing explanations of the data. Instead, we find that
              the data are consistent with a ``two-epoch'' model of adaptation,
              in which an initial burst of diminishing-returns epistasis is
              followed by a steady accumulation of mutations under a constant
              distribution of fitness effects. Our results highlight the need
              for additional DNA sequencing of these populations, as well as
              for more sophisticated models of epistasis that are compatible
              with all of the experimental data.",

              populations evolving under more complex selection for growth rate

              Observed genetic covariance is most often interpreted in
              pleiotropic terms. In particular, functional constraints
              restricting which phenotypes are physically possible can lead to
              a stable G matrix with high genetic variance in
              fitness-associated traits, and high pleiotropic negative
              covariance along the phenotypic curve of constraint. In contrast,
              population genetic models of relative fitness assume endless
              adaptation without constraint, through a series of selective
              sweeps that are well described by recent traveling wave models.
              We describe the implications of such population genetic models
              for the G matrix when pleiotropy is excluded by design, such that
              all covariance comes from linkage disequilibrium. The G matrix is

              the timescale of selective sweeps. However, its orientation is
              relatively stable, corresponding to high genetic variance in

              mechanisms drive the instabilities along vs. perpendicular to the
              fitness gradient. The origin of linkage disequilibrium is not
              drift, but small amounts of linkage disequilibrium are instead
              introduced by mutation and then amplified during competing
              selective sweeps. This illustrates the need to integrate a

               alternative resources is thought to be a primary cause of
               adaptive radiation. I transplanted two recently diverged
               stickleback species (Gasterosteus sp.) and their Hybrids between
               habitats to test three predictions of this hypothesis: (1) the
               form of natural selection on feeding traits should differ
               between resource environments; (2) fitness trade?offs should
               occur between morphs specialized for different resources; (3)
               feeding efficiency should be the basis of fitness differences
               between morphs. Growth rate was used as a surrogate component of
               fitness. All three predictions were upheld. The larger of the
               two species (the Benthic), which has a larger mouth, deeper
               body, and fewer, shorter gill rakers than the second species
               (the Limnetic), had a twofold growth advantage in the littoral
               zone of the lake. This pattern was reversed in the open?water
               habitat, where the Limnetic species grew at double the rate of
               the Benthic. Hybrids, which are morphologically intermediate,
               tended to be intermediate in growth in both habitats. Growth
               rates were closely predicted by earlier laboratory measurements
               of feeding efficiency of the three forms in the same habitats,
               thus linking growth (and probably fitness) with feeding
               performance and morphology. I compare the strengths of the
               present approach with other methods that have been used to test
               the role of resources in adaptive radiation. I also argue that
               steep trade?offs in fitness along the littoral?open?water
               habitat gradient have two further consequences. First, they may
               cause Hybrids to have low fitness, allowing Benthics and
               Limnetics to coexist in the absence of perfect premating
               isolation between them. Second, they may promote ecological
               character displacement. Steep trade?offs may thus help explain
               why divergence along the littoral?open?water gradient is so
               common in fish that have colonized low?diversity lakes.",

               variant carrying destabilizing mutations in its N-terminal and

               illumination with blue light without the need of additional
               chemicals. When compared to existing photoactivatable Cre
               recombinases based on two split units, LiCre displayed faster
               and stronger activation by light as well as a lower residual
               activity in the dark. LiCre was efficient both in yeast, where
               it allowed us to control the production of $\beta$-carotene with
               light, and human cells. Given its simplicity and performances,
               LiCre is particularly suited for fundamental and biomedical

              experiments show consistent patterns of fitness increase between

  abstract = "Evolutionary adaptation to a constant environment is driven by
              the accumulation of mutations which can have a range of
              unrealized pleiotropic effects in other environments. These
              pleiotropic consequences of adaptation can influence the
              emergence of specialists or generalists, and are critical for
              evolution in temporally or spatially fluctuating environments.
              While many experiments have examined the pleiotropic effects of
              adaptation at a snapshot in time, very few have observed the
              dynamics by which these effects emerge and evolve. Here, we
              propagated hundreds of diploid and haploid laboratory budding
              yeast populations in each of three environments, and then assayed
              their fitness in multiple environments over 1000 generations of
              evolution. We find that replicate populations evolved in the same
              condition share common patterns of pleiotropic effects across
              other environments, which emerge within the first several hundred
              generations of evolution. However, we also find dynamic and
              environment-specific variability within these trends: variability
              in pleiotropic effects tends to increase over time, with the
              extent of variability depending on the evolution environment.
              These results suggest shifting and overlapping contributions of
              chance and contingency to the pleiotropic effects of adaptation,

              early, if not being the initiating event, these mutational biases
              are ostensibly a product of how normal cells respond to the
              encoded oncoprotein. Oncogenic mutations can impact not only the
              level of active oncoprotein, but also engagement with proteins.
              To attempt to separate these two effects, we generated four novel
              Cre-inducible (LSL) Kras alleles in mice with the biochemically
              distinct G12D or Q61R mutations and encoded by native (nat) rare
              or common (com) codons to produce low or high protein levels.
              While there were similarities, each allele also induced a
              distinct transcriptional response shortly after activation in
              vivo. At one end of the spectrum, activating the KrasLSL-natG12D
              allele induced transcriptional hallmarks suggestive of an
              expansion of multipotent cells, while at the other end,
              activating the KrasLSL-comQ61R allele led to hallmarks of
              hyperproliferation and oncogenic stress. Evidence suggests that
              these changes may be a product of signaling differences due to
              increased protein expression as well as the specific mutation. To
              determine the impact of these distinct responses on RAS
              mutational patterning in vivo, all four alleles were globally
              activated, revealing that hematolymphopoietic lesions were
              permissive to the level of active oncoprotein, squamous tumors
              were permissive to the G12D mutant, while carcinomas were
              permissive to both these features. We suggest that different KRAS
              mutations impart unique signaling properties that are
